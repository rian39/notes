(Shapin 1984)

The popularization of science is usually
understood as the extension of experience from the few to the
many. I argue here that one of the major resources for generating
and validating items of knowledge within the scientific community
under study was this same extension of experience from the few to
the many: the creation of a scientific public. 481

There was not, nor
can there be, any such thing as a report which notes all
circumstances which might affect an experiment. Circumstantial,
or stylized, accounts do not, therefore, exist as pure forms but as
publicly acknowledged moves towards or away from the reporting
of contingencies. 494

Matters of fact were to
be produced in a public space: a particular space in which
experiments were collectively performed and directly witnessed and
an abstract space constituted through virtual witnessing. 497

The Royal Society advertised itself as a 'union of eyes, and hands';
the space in which it produced its experimental knowledge was
stipulated to be a public space. It was public in a very precisely
defined and very rigorously policed sense: not everyone could come
in; not everyone's testimony was of equal worth; not everyone was
equally able to influence the official voice of the institution. 508

The literary technology of
virtual witnessing supplemented the public space of the laboratory
by extending a valid witnessing experience to all readers of the text. 509

Trust and assent had to be won from a
public that might crucially deny trust and assent. 511
