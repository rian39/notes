Any sociology of knowledge today must address the background role of digital infrastructure (algorithms, analytics, architectures, platforms) in shaping what counts as ‘reality’. This requires – hence the term social analytics – detailed accounts of how social actors construct their own online presence and develop a reflexive relationship to the infrastructures of digital presence. Such detailed accounts constitute what we call ‘real social analytics’, and contribute to a phenomenology of the digital world. p1

Our starting-point is not so much a ‘web epistemology’ (Rogers 2010) as a renewed attention to everyday engagements with the epistemological questions raised by the digital infrastructures through which social actors are, increasingly, coming to know themselves. 6

if ‘presence’ for social actors now necessarily involves being categorised and measured by automated processes over which the social actor may have little control, or even awareness, how is this relationship experienced? 24

Such social actors, far from being operating unreflexively under the weight of algorithmic power, are now required to pursue reflexivity about their goals under ‘algorithmic’ conditions not of their own choosing, but over which they may seek to acquire some reflexive control. Tracking those processes of reflexive adjustment, in all their complexity, distinguishes social analytics’ concerns from the everyday use of analytics as such, which is now routine in countless organizations, enterprises and businesses. Indeed, from the study of such reflexive tensions emerges a new topic for sociology and for a phenomenology of the digital age, which goes unnoticed by general analyses of algorithmic power. 26
