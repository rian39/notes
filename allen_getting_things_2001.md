I think efficiency is a good thing. ... 
And whatever you're doing, you'd probably like to be more relaxed, confident that whatever you're doing at the moment is just what you need to be doing. xi
The power, simplicity, and effectiveness of what I'm talking about in Getting Things Done  are best experienced as experiences, in real time, with real situations in your real world. xiii
It's possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of things to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control. That's a great way to live and work, at elevated levels of effectiveness and efficiency. 3
The methods I present here are based on two key objectives: (1) capturing all the things that need get done­---now, later, someday, big, little, or in between—into a logical and trusted system outside of your head and off your mind; and (2) disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all the “inputs” you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for “next actions” that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.4
We're allowing in huge amounts of information and communication from the outer world and generating an equally large volume of ideas and agreements with ourselves and others from our inner world. And we haven't been well equipped to deal with this huge number of internal and external commitments. 7
These has been a missing piece in our new culture of knowledge work: a system with a coherent set of behaviours and tools that functions effectively at the level at which work really happens. 9
Reflect for a moment on what it actually might be like if your personal management situation were totally under control, at all levels and all times. What if you could dedicate full 100 per cent of your attention to whatever was at hand, at you own choosing with no distraction? 9
Welcome to the real-life experience of “knowledge  work,” and profound operational principle: You have to think about your stuff more than you realize but not as much as you're afraid you might. 15
Thinking in a concentrate manner to define desired outcomes is something few people feel that have to do. But in truth, outcome thinking is one of the most effective means available for making wishes reality. 15
“Stuff” is not inherently a bad thing. Things that command our attentions, by their very nature, usually show up as “stuff.” But once “stuff” comes into our lives and work, we have an inherent commitment to ourselves to define and clarify its meaning. That's our responsibility as knowledge workers; 17
There is no real way to achieve the kind of relaxed control I'm promising if you keep things only in your head. 21
No matter what the setting, there are five discrete stages that we go through as we deal with our work. We (1) collect  things that command our attention; (2) process what they mean and what to do about them; and (3) organize  the results, which we (4) reviewas options for what we choose to (5) do. 24
The “next action” is the next physical, visible activity that needs to be engaged in, in order to move the currently reality toward completion. 34
Any longer-than-two-minute, nondelegatable action you have identified needs to be traced somewhere. 41
Everything that might potentially require action must be reviewed on a frequent enough basis to keep your mind from taking back the job of remembering and reminding. 46
So how will you decide what to do and what not  to do, and feel good about both?
The answer is, by trusting your intuition. If you have collected, processed, organized, and reviewed all your current commitments, you can galvanize your intuitive judgment with some intelligent and practice thinking about your work and values. 48
Horizontal focus is you'll need in most situations, most of the time. Sometimes, however, you may need greater rigor and focus to get a project under control, to identify a solution, or to ensure that all the right steps have been determined. This is where vertical focus comes in. Knowing how to think productively in this more “vertical” way and how to integrate the results into your personal system is the second powerful behavior need for knowledge work. 54
The good news is, there is  a productive way to think about projects, situations, and topics that creates maximum value with minimal expenditure of time and effort. It happens to be the way we naturally  plan when we consciously try to get a project under control. 55
You're already familiar with the most brilliant and creative planner in the world: your brain. You yourself are actually a planning machine. 56
you won't see how to do it until you see yourself doing it 68
Psychologists are beginning to label this “distributed cognition.” It's getting things out of your head and into objective, reviewable formats. 72
The question to ask here is, “What's the next action?”
... this kind of grounded reality-based thinking, combined with clarification of the desired outcome, forms the critical component of knowledge work. 76
The habit of clarifying the next action on projects, not matter what the situations, is fundamental to  you staying in relaxed control. 77
In general , the reason things are on your mind is that the outcome and action steps(s) have not been appropriately defined, and/or reminders of them have not been put in places where you can be trusted to look for them appropriately. 78
The fundamentals remain true---you must be responsible for collecting all your open loops, applying a front-end thought process to each of them, and managing the results with organization, review and action. 80
Merely having the ability  to be highly productive, relaxed, and in control doesn't make you that way. If you're like most people, you can use a coach. 81
To a great degree, the highest-performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives. I know that's true for me. The smart part of us sets up things for us to do that the not-so-smart part responds to almost automatically, creating  behaviour that produces high-performance results. We trick ourselves into doing what we ought to be doing. 86
You'll need a physical location to serve as a central cockpit of control. 89
Label your file folders with an autolabeler. Typeset label change the nature of your files and your relationship to them. 100
There are very practical reasons to gather everything before you start processing it. 105
Assuming that you have collected everything that has your attention, your job now is to actually get to bottom of “in.” 119
You may find you have a tendency, while processing your in-basket, to pick something up, not know exactly what you want to do about it, and then let your eyes wander onto another item farther down the stack and get engaged with it. ...This is dangerous territory. 123
The Action Step Needs to Be the Absolute Next Physical Thing To Do Remember that these are physical, visible activities. 130
There's always some physical activity that can be done to facilitate your decision-making. 130
You have three options once you decide what the next action really is. 
Do it (if the action takes less than two minutes).
Delegate it (if you're not the most appropriate person to do the action).
Defer it  into your organization system as an option for work to do later. 131
I define a “project” as any outcome you're committed to achieving that will take more than one action step to complete. 136
Having a total and seamless system of organization in place gives you tremendous power because it allows your mind to let go of lower-level thinking and graduate to intuitive focusing, undistracted by matters that haven't been dealt with appropriately. But your physical organization system must be better than your mental one in order for that to happen. 138
