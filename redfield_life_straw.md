Even now, relatively little science studies scholarship addresses technology outside highly developed landscapes, particularly at the micro-level of modest miracles and mundane practice. For its part, postcolonial critique favors sweeping rhetoric and the vast geohistorical tableaus of a global North and South, rarely considering technical details at all. 160

Alongside the ever- expanding flotsam of commodities washed into villages by market flows, a new wave of well-intentioned devices from social entrepreneurs seeks to address problems of disaster and extreme poverty. 160

First, I wish to consider aspects of a ‘postcolonial condition’ at the micro-level of daily needs, including political assumptions about the nation state as a legitimate as well as normative form. Second, I want to emphasize science and technology in the form of infrastructure, the material frontline of norms that define ‘modernity’, particularly in their absence. Third, I desire to return reflexively to love, particularly the complicated allure of engagement in academic work. 161

Once in place, the LifeStraw requires only minimal support systems beyond its own particular assemblage. Eminently mobile and focused on survival needs, it also displays ambitions to function as a substitute micro-infrastructure, one divorced from any project of extending a grid of urban services. 173

On initial inspection, three features stand out. First, unlike major development projects focusing on large-scale endeavors such as dams, housing projects or even clinics, innovations like the LifeStraw operate with minimalist materials and an ecological ethos (whether or not fully realized in practice). Second, unlike previous forms of alternative technologies, they incorporate extensive monitoring and evaluation into their plans. Third, while claiming humanitarian values of improving health and saving lives, they profess little faith in states or traditional forms of aid, focusing instead on microscale market opportunities, community will and the miracle of innovation 175 

By short-circuiting the gap between distant problems and technical imagination, they bring those problems within reach of individual initiative, framing a response as a
potential, achievable ‘fix’. 175

It should come as no surprise then, if the field of affect around this form of design stretches into a complex of contradictory reactions, mixing passion with ambivalence, hope with doubt or even despair. 176

Indeed, if anything, a pulse of innovation courses through the market, not just in its endless stream of generic commodities, but also targeted, designed, well-intentioned goods – gadget capitalism with a human face. 176 

Ambivalence is rarely a satisfying feeling. It can, however, serve as a prompt for continued inquiry. So too can concern and care, even in a muddled, imperfect world. 176
