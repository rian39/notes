We start with the ordinary (representationist/epistemological) assumption that concepts are the site of difference. Then we argue that in order for difference to be taken seriously (as ‘alterity’), the assumption that concepts are ontologically distinct from the things to which they are ordinarily said to ‘refer’ must be discarded. From this it follow that alterity can quite properly be thought of as a property of things - things, that is, which are concepts as much as they appear to us as ‘material’ or ‘physical’ entities. 13

[O]ur experience of things, if you will, can be conceptual. 13 {#device} {#thought} {#experience}
