[TBA - some quotes on what abstract machines are]


Denotation disappears in the face of the process described by Peirce as 'diagrammatization.' The function of re-territorializing images, indexes and concepts is replaced by the operation of signs as the foundation for abstract machines and the simulation of physical machinic processes. ... The stratum of signification disappears no longer are there two levels and a system of double articulation; there is only a constant return to the continuum of machinic intensities based on  a pluralism of articulations. 95

Diagrammaticism brings into play more or less de-territorialized trans-semiotic forces, systems of signs, of code, of catalysts and so on, that make it possible in various specific ways to cut across stratifications of every kind. 145 {#diagram} {#platform-stack}

Thus there can be no question of any self-existent Truth. A proposition is true in a particular machinic field; when any material or semiotic machine changes things, it will cease to be true. 145

One can always replace any pronoun with 'it', which covers all pronominality, be it personal, demonstrative, possessive, interrogative or indefinite, whether it refers to adjectives or verbs.  135

The system of diagrammatic signs parallels real de-territorialization, performing its silent and motionless dance on the plane of consistency away from any machinic manifestation in time, in space or in substances of expression. 139

Once an a-signifying machine has been 'liberated' -- as for example the banking system of the Venice, Genoa, Pisa triangle in the Renaissance -- it is immediately taken over by a double articulation machine that limits its effects by subjecting them in practice to the particular content system of an oligarchical society 139

For example, take the verb 'moving'; if we write 'it-moving' we are expressing a multiplicity in a diagrammatic way. It-moving indicates a complex abstract machine which can appear independent of any subjective tendency -- it could refer to an individual, an army, an insect, an object, a machine, an emotion, an idea. It allows for the all the possibilities of moving, so that the verb retains it machinic character. 139 {#diagram}
