In the sources pertaining to the problems of the electric power systems, rarely was more than a passing reference to labor costs encountered. Instead, the emphasis was on load factor.[@Hughes_1993,463] {#economisation}

Such encompassing systems should be labeled sociotechnical systems rather than technological systems. These sociotechnical systems had high momentum,force,and direction because of their institutionally structured nature, heavy capital investments, supportive legislation,and the commitment of know-how and experience. This momentum was a conservative force reacting against abrupt changes in the line of development.465 {#ensemble}
