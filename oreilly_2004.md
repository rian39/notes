What we really at O'Reilly is watch technology and try to learn from it. ..

Watching the alpha-geeks. We look for people who know more than we do,
I remember this great phrase from the science fiction writer, Arthur C. Clarke which said, 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic', and I've always felt a lot of my business involved going around looking for magic. And then try to understand the magician's secrets and write them down so it wouldn't be magic anymore. 
Another way I've framed the mission of my company is 'Changing the world by capturing the knowledge of innovators.' Finding people who are out there on the frontlines, on the front curves, doing new things, and then taking that knowledge and helping to make it more accessible to people who don't necessarily have the access to those innovators that I might have.
