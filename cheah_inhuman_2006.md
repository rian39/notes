The fact that the proper functioning of a political public sphere is always dependent on external formative conditions puts the autonomy of the political into question. Put another way, the spontaneity of Offentlichkeit is not quite that of the self-recursive organism. Because the economic conditions for public deliberation are established by instrumental action or techne, its spontaneity is itself is a product of techne. 78
This constitutive heteronomy subjects public deliberation to a strict law of contamination whose consequences have to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. 79
