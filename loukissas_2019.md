But this
is not the case. I contend that we must rethink our terms and habits around public data
by learning to analyze data settings rather than data sets. 2

The accessions data of the Arnold Arboretum can help us understand, first and foremost, that data have complex attachments to place, which invisibly structure their form and interpretation.  • The DPLA can help us see that data are collected from heterogeneous sources, each with their own local attachments. • NewsScape offers an opportunity to learn how data and algorithms are entangled, with far-reaching implications for what it may mean to be informed in the future. • Finally, the case of Zillow shows how interfaces recontextualize data, with striking consequences for the value that we place on our homes and those of others.i 3

The book asks readers to consider how a local perspective can transform practices designed to make sense of data. Readers will learn how to engage with the local conditions of data pro- ductively in ways that lead toward just ends for those who make, use, or are themselves the subjects of data. Few of us today do not fall into one or more of these categories. 11

ch 1 local

What does it mean to take a local stance in data gathering
and analysis? How can we get local audiences to care about data? What do models of
local practice with data look like? 24

The usefulness of the term local depends on its relative nature. Every local condition
must be defined in its own way. 21

ch2
Data have complex attachments to place, which invisibly structure their form and inter-
pretation. This is the second of six principles that frame the book. Place is routinely over-
looked as a dimension of situatedness in social studies of data.29

So far I have revealed how place appears in data, and how data appear in place. There
is also the important matter of how a place affects data’s production. 34

I use the term visualization to describe the experience of looking at the whole arbo-
retum through the data of its parts. Rather than being a god’s-eye view, characterized
by theorist of science and technology Donna Haraway as one that seems to come “from
nowhere, from simplicity,” these visualizations offer situated but wide-ranging perspec-
tives: views of data as opposed to views through data.22 Creating this kind of visual-
ization requires a critical sensibility toward data, including attention to what might be
occluded and what other vantage points are possible. This approach complements prior
work in geography on the critical studies of landscape representation as well as the
development of critical practices in mapping. 40

Here I use place to mean an institutionally defined framework with social, techno-
logical, and spatial dimensions, in which data are created, displayed, and/or managed,
and that reciprocally, is shaped by those practices. Indeed, data are not simply site-
specific tools; they have the power to shape place. In common parlance, the term data
can be used to mean secondary, digital representations of objects that hold scientific
and cultural import. But data can also create an ontological “looping effect” whereby
they help to shape the practices and institutions that create them. 52
