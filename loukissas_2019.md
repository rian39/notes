But this
is not the case. I contend that we must rethink our terms and habits around public data
by learning to analyze data settings rather than data sets. 2

The accessions data of the Arnold Arboretum can help us understand, first and foremost, that data have complex attachments to place, which invisibly structure their form and interpretation.  • The DPLA can help us see that data are collected from heterogeneous sources, each with their own local attachments. • NewsScape offers an opportunity to learn how data and algorithms are entangled, with far-reaching implications for what it may mean to be informed in the future. • Finally, the case of Zillow shows how interfaces recontextualize data, with striking consequences for the value that we place on our homes and those of others.i 3

The book asks readers to consider how a local perspective can transform practices designed to make sense of data. Readers will learn how to engage with the local conditions of data pro- ductively in ways that lead toward just ends for those who make, use, or are themselves the subjects of data. Few of us today do not fall into one or more of these categories. 11
