But this is not the case. I contend that we must rethink our terms and habits around public data by learning to analyze data settings rather than data sets. 2

The accessions data of the Arnold Arboretum can help us understand, first and foremost, that data have complex attachments to place, which invisibly structure their form and interpretation.  • The DPLA can help us see that data are collected from heterogeneous sources, each with their own local attachments. • NewsScape offers an opportunity to learn how data and algorithms are entangled, with far-reaching implications for what it may mean to be informed in the future. • Finally, the case of Zillow shows how interfaces recontextualize data, with striking consequences for the value that we place on our homes and those of others.i 3

The book asks readers to consider how a local perspective can transform practices designed to make sense of data. Readers will learn how to engage with the local conditions of data pro ductively in ways that lead toward just ends for those who make, use, or are themselves the subjects of data. Few of us today do not fall into one or more of these categories. 11

ch 1 local

What does it mean to take a local stance in data gathering
and analysis? How can we get local audiences to care about data? What do models of local practice with data look like? 24

The usefulness of the term local depends on its relative nature. Every local condition must be defined in its own way. 21

ch2
Data have complex attachments to place, which invisibly structure their form and interpretation. This is the second of six principles that frame the book. Place is routinely over- looked as a dimension of situatedness in social studies of data.29

So far I have revealed how place appears in data, and how data appear in place. There is also the important matter of how a place affects data’s production. 34

I use the term visualization to describe the experience of looking at the whole arboretum through the data of its parts. Rather than being a god’s-eye view, characterized
by theorist of science and technology Donna Haraway as one that seems to come “from nowhere, from simplicity,” these visualizations offer situated but wide-ranging perspec- tives: views of data as opposed to views through data.22 Creating this kind of visual- ization requires a critical sensibility toward data, including attention to what might be occluded and what other vantage points are possible. This approach complements prior work in geography on the critical studies of landscape representation as well as the
development of critical practices in mapping. 40

Here I use place to mean an institutionally defined framework with social, technological, and spatial dimensions, in which data are created, displayed, and/or managed, and that reciprocally, is shaped by those practices. Indeed, data are not simply site- specific tools; they have the power to shape place. In common parlance, the term data can be used to mean secondary, digital representations of objects that hold scientific and cultural import. But data can also create an ontological “looping effect” whereby they help to shape the practices and institutions that create them. 52

## ch3 collecting infrastructures

has stuff on visualizing the local

I propose that working effectively and ethically with data infrastructures means seeing them through a comparative lens—by acknowledging the whole as well as its local, heterogeneous parts. Local readings of data infrastructures, informed by inter- views with those who make and use data, can reveal the variety of local ties that they harbor in classifications, schemata, constraints, errors, absences, and rituals. Seeing data infrastructures as assembled from local conditions opens up new opportunities and obligations for scholarship as well as pedagogy and practice. 92

## ch4 news

Datafication is one of the primary mechanisms in the assembly of big data, and it has been used to digitally capture infor- mation about many of our social behaviors: our everyday movements are monitored by the handheld devices that we carry with us; our spending patterns are registered at the checkout line; and our reading habits are tracked online. In considering the results of datafication, as in other examples explored throughout this book, we must come to terms with their locality.

good description of how interfaces placelessise the data; even as they contextualise, interfaces can be de-contextualsing; the example is the zillow data But there are many other domains from which important examples might be drawn: health, crime, and climate change, to name a few. In all of these areas, practitioners who design inter- faces to data do not act autonomously. Rather, they must connect with cultures of use to support data-driven action. For data are made actionable in culturally rooted knowl- edge systems: consumerist, civic, or otherwise.

Through visual, discursive, and algorithmic devices, Zillow has constructed an attention-grabbing interface that supports the use of data to buy, rent, or sell housing. The operational context that Zillow has assembled, how- ever, also reifies dominant and deeply problematic relationships inherent to our market- based culture of real estate.


## ch7

One way of doing so, and the departing recommendation of this book, is to estab- lish a new genre of open data guides, which can introduce potential users to data set- tings and not just data sets. What might local guides for open data consist of, who will make them, and how will they affect data use? This is a pressing research question for all of us. - good set of instructions on how to do a data guide in this chapter;
