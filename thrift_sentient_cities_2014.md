Thrift_Sentient_Cities_2014

Take just the case of coded cities understood as a whole. Should we think of them simply as projections of an autistic capitalist power in which all consequences are externalized? Should we think of them as entities gathered around matters of prescribed concern and uninterested in much that lies outside them? Should we see them as tied into a kind of ethic of care by the need to roll over systems which demand resilience? Should we see them as having an increasingly involved dream life, based on projection and retrojection of all the searches, blogs and tweets that are continually being generated? Should we see them as geometric beings, born out of constant requests for navigation? Should we see them as the result of newly found abilities to represent arising out of advances in visualization? There is no set format or single cause but what is clear is that it is increasingly possible for these entities to learn – in however a limited way – to transform themselves, to author themselves either through emergent tendencies arising out of complexity or through simple happenstance which places them in unexpected situations which require adaptation. 13
