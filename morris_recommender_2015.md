By looking at the transition from intermediation to infomediation, this article considers the new infomediary logics at work in the production of culture and explores what is at stake at the intersection of data mining, taste making and audience manufacture. In doing so, it attends to the computational forms of power shaping popular culture and interrogates the social implications of curation by code.448 {#culture} {#power}

Ultimately, thinking about recommendation services as infomediaries offers several contributions to existing literature on both algorithms and cultural intermediaries. First, it helps us place algorithms and recommendation systems in their industrial context, removing them from some of the mystery shrouded in technical language and placing them squarely as actors in the cultural industries that deserve equal attention as other cultural intermediaries or actors involved in intermediation. This entails not only under- standing the various cultures of those who create the algorithms (see, for example, Nick Seaverâ€™s (2012) ongoing ethnographic work on music intelligence companies), but also trying to probe the algorithms and recommendation systems themselves to reverse- engineer their logics (Madrigal, 2014). Second, it broadens our understanding of cultural intermediaries to see them as a combination of human actors and technical devices. This has long been the case, though not often recognized in the literature on cultural interme- diaries. The legitimacy of the work of cultural intermediaries is often dependent on a particular knowledge and use of certain technologies. Infomediaries foreground this hybridity. Third, infomediaries also point us to the increasing power information and the organization of information play in the infrastructures of the cultural industries. Data collection about uses and preferences is now embedded directly into the processes of presentation and consumption of cultural content. 459 {#media}
