The distinctive intermediary logic of the platform materialises through a particular
configuration of socio-technical practices. 7

These layers are: first, a network or community layer, which consists of platform participants and the relationships between them; second, an infrastructure layer, which is made up of software tools, rules and services; and third, a data layer, which allows the platform to attempt to match supply with demand. The webpages and marketing pitches of platforms are crucial to the first of these ‘layers’, and typically produce a participatory economic culture that plays to the broader and deeper cultural rhetoric about the inclusive and democratising qualities of the internet (van Dijck, 2013: 9-10). To a greater-or- lesser extent, different platform types attempt to enrol participants who are figured not as ‘consumers’ but as ‘users’ who ‘co-create value’. In Choudary’s (2015: 43) terms, “platforms must invest in behavior design”, eliciting “new behaviors that had never existed in the past” and ensuring that “users stick around of their own accord” (emphasis in original). Put differently, and in the more critical terms of Lovink and Tkacz (2015: 14), the intermediation of networked economic connectivity features the summoning-up of the popular passions and interests of what they call the “platformed masses”. 7

Contrary to the meanings that might be implied by the metaphor of ‘infrastructure’, however, platforms are not utilities or conduits that simply channel circulations. Platforms actively induce, produce and programme circulations. As Beer (2013) notes in relation to the infrastructures of Web 2.0, platforms realise and act upon data (through archiving and algorithms, for example) in ways that feed-back, structure, delimit and
even determine the circulations of popular culture. 9 

what is important is how platforms build ostensibly stabilising reputation economies into the infrastructures of digital economic circulation. Ideas, knowledge, labour and use rights for otherwise idle assets in circulation are thus qualified in a manner that appears thoroughly consistent with the figurative positioning of the platform as an enabler of participatory economic culture. 10 

The business model is also crucial to a platform-centred understanding of digital
economic circulation in a second and further respect: the model provides for a relatively
coherent and powerful framing of the valuation and capitalisation of the platform. 12

When placing the platform at the centre of critical understandings of digital economic circulation, moreover, we have suggested that the platform is not merely a manifestation of wider transformations in the relations and structures of contemporary capitalism. For us, analytical attention should be given to the contingent configuration and consequences of the platform as a discrete mode of socio-technical intermediary and capitalist business arrangement. 15
