The success or failure of a large system often turns around the outcome of ' five to ten key decisions. Ideally these critical choices should be identified, made rationally, at the right time, and communicated to those who need to know. Important decisions within projects are often made sub-consciously: individually, illogically, in the wrong order, or by the wrong people. Decisions are needed throughout the whole development process - on what life ' cycle to use, what design architecture to have, whether to develop internally or buy in equipment. 164

Decision-making is intimately involved with system information - decisions are made on the basis of requirements, and new requirements are 'derived' -: a result. Every decision should be made by evaluating different solutions against a set of criteria. The criteria are themselves requirements - typically a summay Of several individual requirements. 164
