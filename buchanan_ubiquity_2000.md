So chaos by itself cannot explain why a butterfly can cause a thunderstorm. Chaos may indeed explain why a tiny cause can quickly make the future different in its details (the positions of many molecules) from what it might have been. But to explain why tiny causes can ultimately lead to great upheavals, we need something else. We may say that although chaos can explain simple unpredictability, it cannot explain upheavability. 15

[T]he ubiquity of the critical state may well be considered the first really solid discovery of complexity theory. 16

So to understand any real physical system at its critical point, you may as well forget all the real, messy details about that system, and focus instead on the simplest mathematical game belonging to the same universality class 82

Things that live in critical states tend to show similar kinds of organisation, and this organisation arises not from specific details of those systems and the elements that make them up, but from the far deeper skeleton of basic geometry and logic behind these details. 83

[W]hen these games were originally invented, their inventors unconsciously chose the parameters in the games so as to place them precisely at the critical point. 100
