Consider something as seemingly mundane as commuting and journey to work. Under the auspices of conceptualization that marginalized mobility, such journeys had been conceived of as dysfunction in spatial systems. One way of talking about time spent commuting (or, indeed, travel time in general) was ‘dead time’. Time spent moving from one place to another was somehow wasted, empty and unproductive. Travel time was separated from activity time as though travel itself was not an activity but a way of getting from one activity time-space to another. The notion of travel time as ‘dead time’ is logically linked to other ways of thinking about travel time through the lens of a broadly conceived sedentarist metaphysics. One such way is to think of travel as a ‘derived demand’ – the notion that travel happens because one important element of life (say residence) happens in one place while another (work, consumption, leisure etc.) happens in another. Thus, you have to move to get from one important thing to another important thing.


Behind each of these is the assumption that proper order is spatially defined and that many forms of mobility are inherently transgressive (Cresswell Citation1996; Halfacree Citation1996).
