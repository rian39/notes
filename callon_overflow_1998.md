The concept of framing indicates that such closure is possible: individuals, whether two or 2,000 in number, whether by communicating through prices or tak­ ing turns to negotiate contracts, together regulate problems of resource allocation or property transfer while simultaneously estab­ lishing a temporarily impenetrable barrier between themselves and the rest of the world. 251

Without the theatre building and its physical devices; without years of training and hours of rehearsal put in by the actors; without the habitual mindset of the audience and carefully written dramas which deliberately limit the range of prepro­ grammed interactions, the framing of a stage performance would be quite simply inconceivable. This viewpoint is thus the exact opposite of the preceding one: instead of regarding framing as something that happens of itself, and overflows as a kind of accident which must be put right, overflows are the rule and framing is a fragile, artificial result based upon substantial investments. 252

Let us start by considering the concept of embeddedness first put forward by Polanyi (Polanyi, 1 975) and subsequently taken up by Granovetter (Granovetter, 1 985). This does not so much represent yet another expression of the implacable hostility between sociology and economics8 as an affirmation of the omnipresence of overflows. 252

In short, the actor's ontology is variable: his or her objectives, interests, will and thus identity are caught up in a process of continual reconfigura­ tion, a process that is intimately related to the constant reconfigura­ tion of the network of interactions in which he or she is involved.253
