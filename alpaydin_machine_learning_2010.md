## Naive Bayes

If the inputs are independent, we have the graph shown in ... which is called the _naive Bayes' classifier_, because it ignores possible dependences, namely, correlations, among the inputs and reduces a multivariate problem to a group of univariate problems. 397

It is as if we first pick a class $C$ at random by sampling from $P(C)$, and then having fixed $C$, we pick as $\mathbf{x}$ by sampling from $p(\mathbf{x}|C)$. ... For example, in text categorization, generating a text may be thought of as the process where an author decides to write a document on a certain topic and then chooses the set of worlds accordingly. 398
