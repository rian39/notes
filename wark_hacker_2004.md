The hacking of new vectors of information has indeed been the turning point in the emergence of a broader awareness of the creative production of abstraction. (071)

By its very nature, the act of hacking overcomes the limits property imposes on it. (080)

The very nature of the hack gives the hacker a crisis of identity. (081)

To hack is to abstract. To abstract is to produce the plane upon which different things may enter into relation. It is to produce the names and numbers, the locations and trajectories of those things. It is to produce kinds of relations, and relations of relations, in which things may enter. (083)

With the commodification of information comes its vectoralization. Extracting a surplus from information requires technologies capable of transporting information through space, but also through time. 318

The whole potential of space and time becomes the object of the vectoral class 318

The vector perfected would be the relation that holds in that world, which is, in every one of its aspects and moments, potentially becoming every other world. 339

Vector subjectivity is abstract, but not universal. It acquires its specificity as the internalizing of the differentiation of values that appear on the abstract plane of the vector. 341
