Do characteristics reside in, or are they attributed to entities? ... As we have suggested, answers to this kind of question vary enormously, both over time and cross-culturally; according to which kind of entity one is discussing; and according to which notions of boundedness inform the discussion. Importantly, views about the capability and boundedness of any one entity are bound up with views about other entities and of the relationship between them. For convenience, we can refer to any existing complex of relationships between entities as the moral order of representation. (Woolgar, 1991, 65)

In other words, representations (descriptions, determinations of many kinds) of ‘what the machine is’ take their sense from descriptions of the ‘machine’s context’; at the same time, an understanding of ‘the context’ derives from a sense of the machine in its context. The sense of context and machine mutually elaborate each other. For that aspect of context called the user, the reflexive tie is especially marked. The capacity and boundedness of the machine take their sense and meaning from the capacity and boundedness of the user. (Woolgar, 1991, 68)

The user is encouraged to find in her dealings with the machine an adequate puzzle for the solution which the machine offers. (Woolgar, 1991, 68)

[C]onfiguring the user involves the determination of likely future requirements and actions of users. Since the company tends to have better access to the future than users, it is the company’s view which defines users’ future requirements.  (Woolgar, 1991, 75)

Here we see that, in the event of uncertainty, users are redirected back to sources - either ‘user documentation’ or the company technical support hotline - which can re-establish the correct pattern of user action, in line with the approved configuration of the user’s relationship with the compnay.  (Woolgar, 1991, 80)

I have argued that user configuration involves boundary work. The user’s character and capacity, her possible future actions are structured and defined in relation to the machine.  (Woolgar, 1991, 89)

We are encouraged carefully to document all the grunts and mutterings of the humans, (many of) their movements and gestures (as if this is going to help), while the actions, motives and intentions of the inanimate objects are treated as irrelevant. ... We clearly need to develop a means of describing the interaction from the machine’s point of view.  (Woolgar, 1991, 90)
