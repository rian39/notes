Is there any way of making a more general assessment of software in the city? 2002,  314

It would be easy at this point to fall back on some familiar notions to describe software’s grip on spaces like cities. One would be hegemony. But that notion suggests a purposeful project, whilst software consists of numerous projects cycling through and continually being rewritten in code. Another notion would be haunting. But again the notion is not quite the right one. Ghosts are ethereal presences, phantoms that are only half- there, which usually obtain their effects by stirring up emotions – of fear, angst, regret, and the like. Software is more like a kind of traffic between beings, wherein one sees, so to speak, the effects of the relationship. What transpires becomes reified in actions, body stances, general anticipations (Strathern 1999). We would argue, then, that soft- ware is best thought of as a kind of absorption, an expectation of what will turn up in the everyday world. Software is a new kind of phenomenality which can ‘touch the ontic’ (Spivak 1993, 30). Software is, in other words, a part of a ‘technologi- cal unconscious’ (Clough 2000), a means of sustain- ing presence which we cannot access but which clearly has effects, a technical substrate of uncon- scious meaning and activity. Thrift-French, 2002, 311-312

The first of these geographies is the most obvious, the large and complex geography of the writing of software – of the production of lines of code – a geography that takes in many different locations and many different languages and which has been built up progressively since the invention of programming in the 1940s.  323

The general profusion of software, its increasing complexity and consequent emergent properties, all count as means of producing playful idioms that have not been captured by dominant orders. Software’s very indeterminacy and lack of closure provide a means of creating new kinds of order. 328
