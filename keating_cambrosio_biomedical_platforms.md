"Platforms'" semantic reach thus embraces natural and artificial entities, material artifacts and their blueprints, and technical, political, material, and symbolic references. At one of the semantic spectrum lies the engineering/physics idea of a simple bench or surface onto which other devices are fixed in a definite but not definitive way. At the other end of the spectrum lies the political platform, an arrangement of statements and positions with respect to particular issues. A platform, then, is less a thing than a way of arranging things in both a material and discursive sense. In both senses (as an instrument or a project), the platform creates the basis for the organization of activities. In neither sense does it offer a foundation for these activities, insofar as its adoption and the comparative advantages it confers require no criterion of truth or any other criterion of correspondence to a specific order of things. 27-28

The order created by a platform, in the simplest sense results from consistency between the various parts, be it consistency of purpose, consistently measurable distances, or consistent interfaces 30.   {#ensemble} {#configuration}

Once a handmaiden to pathology, biology now counts as the ultimate description and account of disease origins and mechanisms 57

What happens, for instance, when scientists and engineers attempt to automate something like 'diagnosing cancer'? Common sense would tell us that someone invents a machine capable of carrying out such an activity. In reality, however, just as diagnosis requires some sort of mechanical mediation -- ... -- there is not machine judgement that substitute for human judgment. Rather researchers rearrange the process of producing that judgment.  59

pathology has access to an independent body of observations that emerge in the clinic in the contact  between the doctor and patient.71

pathology precedes physiology 72

cf their arguments about the creation of biomedicine

for equipment to function as a platform, one needs regulatory conventions that are incompletely embodied in the material components of the platform 91 {#scientific-instrument}{#regulation}

What matters is the flexible, yet clearly identifiable combination of elements 107 {#combination}

differ from networks: 'insofar as they embody regulations and conventions of equivalence, exchange and circulation' [@Keating_2003, 324] {#network} {#platform-definition}

Platforms embody a new form of objectivity, a regulatory one, grounded in the procedures of internal quality control, and, especially, external quality assessment. 332	{#objectivity} {#regulation}

biomedical platforms are material and discursive arrangements that act as the bench upon which conventions concerning the biological or normal are connected with conventions concerning the medical or the pathological. 332 {#biomedicine} {#biology} {#platform-definition}

>the bench upon which conventions concerning the biological or normal are articulated with or connected to conventions concerning the medical or pathological. As such they define the standards according to which biomedical actions are evaluated [@Keating_2003, 327]. 

variation is the rule and much [of] the regulation that goes into the maintenance of a platform consists in discovering how much variation there is. 330 {#regulation} {#differences} 

regulation is a constitutive component of the platform. 331

The notion of platform enlarges the connotation of regulation which, when viewed in terms of platforms, no longer appears as an obstacle to fruitful work or innovation, targeting mainly routine activities. Regulation now appears as a condition for the production, circulation, and interchangeability of novel entities and practices. 331-332 {#regulation} {#thought}

Going beyond the innovation/routine dichotomy, platform sociology thus opens up the field for the investigation of those activities that, borrowing a term from evolutionary economics, can be termed "innovating routines." 332

To understand biomedicine is to understand its regulation. 334

start right in the middle of the game with regulation. Look, for instance, to quality-control procedures, the meetings and discussions surrounding their development and enforcement, ... move up and down the regulatory continuum,  ...  Finally, look for alignments with other forms of work. 335 {#method} {#regulation} {#work}
