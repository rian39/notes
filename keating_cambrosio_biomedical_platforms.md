Keating, P. and A. Cambrosio (2003). _Biomedical platforms : realigning the normal and the pathological in late-twentieth-century medicine_ Cambridge, Mass., MIT Press.

Platforms embody a new form of objectivity, a regulatory once, grounded in the procedures of internal quality control, and, especially, external quality assessment. 332	

biomedical platforms are material and discursive arrangements that act as the bench upon which conventions concerning the biological or normal are connected with conventions concerning the medical or the pathological. 332

Once a handmaiden to pathology, biology now counts as the ultimate description and account of disease origins and mechanisms 57

What happens, for instance, when scientists and engineers attempt to automate something like 'diagnosing cancer'? Common sense would tell us that someone invents a machine capable of carrying out such an activity. In reality, however, just as diagnosis requires some sort of mechanical mediation -- ... -- there is not machine judgement that substittute for human jdugment. Rather researchers rearragne the process of producing that judgment.  59
