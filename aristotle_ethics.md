Since there are three kinds of modification to be found in the soul, viz. feelings (pathos), faculties (dynamis) and dispositions (hexis), virtue must be one of these three. 98

So if the virtues are neither feelings nor faculties, its remains that they are dispositions. 99


If good craftsmen, as we hold, work with the mean in view; and if virtue, like nature, is more exact and more efficient than any art, its follows that virtue aims to hit the mean. 101

So virtue is a purposive disposition, lying in a mean that is relative to us and determined by a rational principle, and by that which a prudent man would use to determine it. 101-102

'phronesis is not concerned with universals only; it must take cognizance of particulars, because it is concerned with conduct, and conduct has its sphere in particular circumstances' Aristotle, Nichomachean Ethics, Bk VI), 213

phronesis is not scientific knowledge because it apprehends the last step, since the thing is to be done is of this nature. 215

hexis -- settled, fully developed state or habit
