In order to engage energy issues from a historical-materialist perspective, the literature must move from conceptions that understand energy as a “thing” or a “resource” towards a conception of energy as a “social relation” enmeshed in dense networks of power and socioecological change.5 Furthermore, fossil fuel energy is a much more historically specific mode of energy and represents a concrete abstraction applicable to only the last 200 years of human history. While ecological economists stress the transhistorical laws of thermodynamics, a historical materialist analysis would emphasize both the particular conditions through which “fossil fuel” became such a useful source of energy and the social consequences of its peculiarly prolific capacities for enhancing productivity. 106

In the broadest terms, human history contains two fundamental energy shifts: 106
nb: this is  a problem – he doesn't really think energy historically?

Any analysis of a mode of production beyond capitalism, or the possible emergence of an “alternative energy economy”, must come to grips with the deep embeddedness of fossil- energy in the most basic forms of commodity circulation. 113

Overall, while most discussions of energy transition focus upon technical innovation and economic/ thermodynamic efficiency, a red–green politics is uniquely positioned to fight for not only a “green” energy future based upon “alternative technologies”, but also a socially just reorientation of society’s productive powers. 113

possible confusion of force, power and energy in this article?
