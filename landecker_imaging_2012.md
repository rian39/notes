These moving images are important even if no one watches them. The very paradox  of  life  being  watched  by  machine,  life  that  has  been  engineered  to  express  the  means  of  its  own  luminosity,  should  cue  the  postgenomic,  postcybernetic  moment  to  which  this  article  attends.  Live-cell  imaging  has  become a constitutive and routine tool in biomedical and life science research; a textbook on the subject notes dryly: ‘It is hard to imagine an active academic research  department,  pharmaceutical  or  biotechnology  company  without  access to this technology and without using it on a regular basis’ (Papkovsky, 2010: v). My consideration of the use of moving images in bioscience today – which is necessarily an encounter with live-cell imaging – is driven by this basic reason: after 2000, it becomes difficult to imagine life without it 379. {#images}{#biology}
