Nancy, J.-L. 2000 Being singular plural, Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press.

Being cannot be anything but being-with-another, circulating in the with and as the with of this singularly plural coexistence. 3
j-l says this as a way of grounding meaning without foundation. There is only circulation, or spacing, 'in all the directions of the space-times' 3
There is no other meaning than the meaning of circulation. 3
the city is not primarily “community,” any more than it is primarily “public space.” The city is at least as much the bringing to light of being-in-common as the dis-position (dispersal and disparity) of the community represented as founded in interiority or transcendence. 23
if Being is Being-with, then it is, in its being-with, the “with” that constitutes Being; the with is not simply an addition 30
In fact, [what is exposed] is the  bare and “content”-less web of “communication.” One could say it is the bare web of the com- (of the telecom-,  said with an acknowledgment of its independence); that is, it is our web or “us” as web or network, an us  that is reticulated and spread out, with its extension for an essence and its spacing for a structure. {Nancy, 2000 #833, 8}
The intuition buried in Marx's work is undoubtedly located in the following ambivalence: at one and the same time, capital exposes the general alienation of the proper – which is the generalized disappropriation, or the appropriation of misery in every sense of the word-- and it exposes the stripping bare of the with as a mark of Being, or as a mark of meaning. 64
We  can never simply be “the we,” understood as a unique subject, or understood as an indistinct “we” that is like a diffuse generality. 65
Looking at it closely, one will find that the various critiques of “spectacular” alienation are, in the end, grounded on the distinction between a good spectacle and a bad spectacle. 68
The being-in-itself of “society” is the network and cross-referencing [le renvoi mutuel] of co-existence, that is, of coexistences. That is why every society gives itself its spectacle and gives itself as spectacle, in one form or another. 69
stuff on capital as baring 73, etc 
Above all else, “body” really means what is outside, insofar as it is outside, next to, against, nearby, with a(n) (other) body, from body to body, in the dis-position. 84
Beings touch; they are in con-tact with one another; they arrange themselves and distinguish themselves in this way. 96
Also sutff on the Self as 'structure of the “with”' 96


A world is a multiplicity of worlds, and its unity is the mutual sharing and exposition of alls its worlds – within this world. 185
