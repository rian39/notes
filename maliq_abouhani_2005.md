Across Africa, a new urban infrastructure is being build with the very bodies and life stories of city residents, but what kind of city is being put together is not clear. This ambiguity is not only a reality that urban residents must face but also one which they must apparently instigate. 3
This infrastructure is also temporal. What appears to be statsis, with nothing apparently accomplished, may actually be the highly intricate engineering of interactions among different events, actors and situations. In such occurrences, events actors and situations may ‘pass through’ each other and take notice of each without conditions actually changing. 3
As large numbers of urban residents no longer have access to either ‘traditional’ or ‘modern’ modalities of social reproduction, the come to rely on provisional  actions, identities and social composition.  ... As a result many places in the city seem far removed from the trajectories of development that obtain in the rest of the world, as if there is little connection, or few possibilities of interaction, between them. 5
As the practices of different localities and regions intersect, new provisional and often ephemeral ‘publics’ can be made. 6
At times, the preoccupation with locality, as the most appropriate level at which to ensure democracy, participation, voice and equality, represents a lingering obsession with finding the right form with which to realize the self-actualization of specific societies. 6
Does this informalization of urban development on a large scale, then, require increased informalization on the part of ‘ordinary citizens’? 7

If the city is a huge intersection of bodies in need and with desires in part propelled by the sheer number of them, how can larger numbers of bodies sustain themselves by asserting themselves at critical junctures, whether these junctures are discrete spaces, life events, sites of consumption or production? 8
What kinds of urban objects, or quasi-object as Serres would call them, elicit .... an ability to operate in concert, without representation, without frameworks of conviction? 8-9
All cities are places of multiple intensities and layers, These layers and intensities pass through, settle, consolidate and disperse across the diverse spaces to which their various intersections give rise. These intensities include populations, sounds, machines, roads, discourses, buildings, grids of water and electricity, organizational forms and sites, nurturing and dispossession, as well as emanations of nature, to name a few. 9
Often groups within the community are more comfortable engaging with ‘like-minded’ or similarly configured identities at great distances rather than the ‘differences’ who live or operate ‘next door.’ 17
Making lives from the provisional is an essentially unstable process, and such instability can produce enormous creative change, but also devolve into spreading violence. 24
