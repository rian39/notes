$$h(t)=\int_0^t f(t-u)g(u)du = \int_0^t f(u)g(t-u)du$$

The function h is known as the convolution of f and g; the integrals are known as convolution integrals 254

Convolution integrals arise in various applications in which the behaviour of the system at time _t_ depends not only on its state at time _t_, but on its past history as well. 255 {#change} {#numbering}
