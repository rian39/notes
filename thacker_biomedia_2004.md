Biomedia are novel configurations of biologies and technologies that take us beyond the familiar tropes of technology-as-tool or the human-machine interface. 6
[B]ioinformatics tools are an example of computer programming creating a context in which certain biological components and processes may function as they do “naturally” in vivo or in vitro. 21
Bioinformatics tools provide a context in which these patterns of relationships are “recoded” as computational integers, algorithms, and sets of rules. 21
What computer science brings to the concepts of molecular biology is the same thing that genetic engineering techniques have brought to it: namely, a view of “the biological” as more than static substance, but relations and functionalities that can be isolated, extracted, relocated, and designed in a range of experimental contexts. 53
