The naive Bayes assumption seldom holds in practice; the world "sildenafil", for example, is far more likely to be found in e-mail messages -- spam and ham alike -- that also contain the word "Viagra". Invalid assumptions aside, naive Bayes classifiers are commonly used because they are simple and perform adequately as hard classifiers with a probability threshold $t=0.5$, even if their probability estimates are far from accurate 345

Provided amenable features are used, a naive Bayes classifier is very easy to implement and there is little difference between batch and on-line versions. 348
Although the naive Bayes method makes an adequate hard classifier, it is a horrible soft classfier because it overestimates the combined effect of the individual features. The more features considered, the larger the overestimate. 348
