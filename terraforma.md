# Model 1 soil

soil; turn the earth inside out; adjust circumference of layers to reflect local importances - air, soil, water, rock, mantle, core; then add things into layers -- living, non-living, natural-artificial; leading to a different sense of place; can all be centred around a place? use contours still to show different heights of things
 

# Model 2 points of life

points of life; modes of attachment to ground, which mean that body and ground go together, literally in the same events. Diagrams have different modes of attachment - welding, and then a series of attachments relating to climate change; Model 2 has an inversion from self-world to world-self; and envelopes are like layers skin including the world; climate affects many of these envelopes, but differently. If skin and ground are continuous, then skin is the real outside, and everythign else comes within, like world or nation.   

## Model 3 living landscapes

follow beings in their movements; delineate their reach; i.e. habitual territories; common landscape follows from their crossings. Human ans non-human;a includes platform landscape; they then arrange all these on the same plane and move them into a circle, the portolan, including classifying them by families of trajectory; the idea is to get from grid to territories  

# model 4 borders

they want to make them thicker; they use spirals to arrange them, and oscillograms to diagram tensions/power forms around them; not sure whether I get this, or maybe it is just no so useful. Do borders just come on top of living landscapes?

# model 5 space-time

A whole set of time-space elements, composed in/on a score, and arranged in overlapping dials. Quite useful.

## model 6 resources

has the idea of suction cups that deplete a territory, neutral zones or inter-biomes as potentially interesting; set of operations for combining the modes of action around resources; 

## model 7 recollections
