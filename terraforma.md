# Model 1 soil

soil; turn the earth inside out; adjust circumference of layers to reflect local importances - air, soil, water, rock, mantle, core; then add things into layers -- living, non-living, natural-artificial; leading to a different sense of place; can all be centred around a place? use contours still to show different heights of things
 

# Model 2 points of life

points of life; modes of attachment to ground, which mean that body and ground go together, literally in the same events. Diagrams have different modes of attachment - welding, and then a series of attachments relating to climate change; Model 2 has an inversion from self-world to world-self; and envelopes are like layers skin including the world; climate affects many of these envelopes, but differently. If skin and ground are continuous, then skin is the real outside, and everythign else comes within, like world or nation.   
The model again has the skin as the outside, then shrinks towards the continent-nation, etc. Love this inversion.

## Model 3 living landscapes

follow beings in their movements; delineate their reach; i.e. habitual territories; common landscape follows from their crossings. Human ans non-human;a includes platform landscape; they then arrange all these on the same plane and move them into a circle, the portolan, including classifying them by families of trajectory; the idea is to get from grid to territories  

# model 4 borders

they want to make them thicker; they use spirals to arrange them, and oscillograms to diagram tensions/power forms around them; not sure whether I get this, or maybe it is just no so useful. Do borders just come on top of living landscapes?

# model 5 space-time

A whole set of time-space elements, composed in/on a score, and arranged in overlapping dials. Quite useful.

## model 6 resources

has the idea of suction cups that deplete a territory, neutral zones or inter-biomes as potentially interesting; set of operations for combining the modes of action around resources; key idea idea: there is no world, there are world-making bodies, weaving a fabric in various ways; they get explicit about the kinds of weaving stitching.  

## model 7 recollections

has an interesting idea of putting time, past and futures around a site. The site is at the centre, and various fossils arranged in relation to practices of repair. They do a time switch in which fossils are flipped towards futures.
