# Model 1

soil; turn the earth inside out; adjust circumference of layers to reflect local importances - air, soil, water, rock, mantle, core; then add things into layers -- living, non-living, natural-artificial; leading to a different sense of place; can all be centred around a place? use contours still to show different heights of things
 

# Model 2 points of life

points of life; modes of attachment to ground, which mean that body and ground go together, literally in the same events. Diagrams have different modes of attachment - welding, and then a series of attachments relating to climate change; Model 2 has an inversion from self-world to world-self; and envelopes are like layers skin including the world; climate affects many of these envelopes, but differently. If skin and ground are continuous, then skin is the real outside, and everythign else comes within, like world or nation.
