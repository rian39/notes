> In contrast to new forms of empiricism, data-driven science seeks to hold to the tenets of the scientific method, but is more open to using a hybrid combin- ation of abductive, inductive and deductive approaches to advance the understanding of a phenomenon. It dif- fers from the traditional, experimental deductive design in that it seeks to generate hypotheses and insights ‘born from the data’ rather than ‘born from the theory’ (Kelling et al., 2009: 613). In other words, it seeks to incorporate a mode of induction into the research design, though explanation through induction is not the intended end-point (as with empiricist approaches). Instead, it forms a new mode of hypothesis generation before a deductive approach is employed. Nor does the process of induction arise from nowhere, but is situated and contextualized within a highly evolved theoretical domain. As such, the epistemological strategy adopted within data-driven science is to use guided knowledge discovery techniques to identify potential questions (hypotheses) worthy of further examination and testing 6

In other words, it is possible to think of new epistemologies that do not dismiss or reject Big Data analytics, but rather employ the meth- odological approach of data-driven science within a different epistemological framing that enables social Downloaded from by guest on February 19, 201510 Big Data & Society scientists to draw valuable insights from Big Data that are situated and reflexive. 9-10

>Given the weak- nesses in the empiricist arguments it seems likely that the data-driven approach will eventually win out and over time, as Big Data becomes more common and new data analytics are advanced, will present a strong chal- lenge to the established knowledge-driven scientific method. To accompany such a transformation the philosophical underpinnings of data-driven science, with respect to its epistemological tenets, principles and methodology, need to be worked through and debated to provide a robust theoretical framework for the new paradigm.

>Within the empiricist frame, data ana- lytics offer the possibility of insightful, objective and profitable knowledge without science or scientists, and their associated overheads of cost, contingencies, and search for explanation and truth. In this sense, whilst the data science techniques employed might hold genu- ine salience for practioners, the articulation of a new empiricism operates as a discursive rhetorical device designed to simplify a more complex epistemological approach and to convince vendors of the utility and value of Big Data analytics.[@Kitchin_2014,5]
