Vision and its effects are always inseparable from the possibilitys of an observing subject who is both the historical product _and_ the site of certain practices, techniques, institutions and procedures of subjectification. 5

concepts of subjective vision, of the productivity of the observer, pervaded not only areas of art and literature but were present in philosophical, scientific, and technological discourses. ... The same knowledge that allowed the increasing rationalization and control of the human subject in terms of new institution and economic requirements was also a condition for new experiments in visual representation. 9.
