>These environments of sensation suggest an alteration to the trajectories through which sensorial encounters are configured, so that sense— or experience— is not exclusively about immediacy or coming into contact but instead also refers to sensory capacities that concresce in relation to environments of sense. 35 Experience occurs within a techno-geographic milieu, since it unfolds within technical and geographical conditions that are further generative of worlds, environments, and relations.

> It may be that these sensor environments of ecological monitoring comprise an even greater store of information from which to act, where the politics of sensing across these distributed and pervasive sites seem to influence even more extensive possibilities for environmental action. Yet the risk is that monitoring could become an end in itself, where sensory data amasses in excess, but these often- distant sites of ecological study present detailed sensory datasets that do not translate into environmental practice. One way to test this concern may be to return to the sites of sensation and to consider the ways in which infoldings, distributions, and environments of sense may recast the scope of our multiple and diverging environmental engagements.
