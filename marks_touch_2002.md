Digital video's virtuality is always hovering at the limin of its audiovisual manifestation. 149

When we see and hear a digital work, we are witnesses to the artist's decision  to render this information in a form more or less lie that from which it derived. The range of choice possible in digital rendering, the number of ways the database can be made manifest, is vast. 149

In principle, digital video, by “knowing” everything that it holds in memory, offers weaker links to the phenomenal world it records. In practice, since both media retain so much more than we human perceivers grasp, each is capable of acting as our surrogate audiovisual preconscious. 149

While analog editing temporalizes, digital editing spatializes. 150

Because it is a database manipulation, digital video erases the difference between editing, animations, and special effects. 151
