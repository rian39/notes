Yes, I think one of the duties of social sciences is precisely to contribute to the explication or articulation of this political space. And what we have tried to do in our recent book Agir dans un monde incertain: Essai sur la démocratie technique is precisely to describe this space where the emerging identities created by techno-sciences’ overflows could be discussed and could be mobilized in order to compose, to constitute, the collective. There’s a strange meshing of techno-sciences and economic markets which produces what Marilyn Strathern calls the proliferation of new identities and which constantly creates new uncertainties about the constitution of the collective. So this constant creation and proliferation of the social (or what we propose to call emerging concerned groups) requires new procedures, new institutions, political institutions, new forms of debates and so on. (287)

But if you consider overflows, you don’t know who is concerned. Is it an individual? Is it a group of individuals?Is it a hybrid collective, mixing humans and non-humans? Nobody is able to answer this question. So it’s a principle of uncertainty about what the collective is made of, or will be made of. This notion of citizenship is usually linked to the notion of an individual or society made of individual citizens who have to be integrated, and who have to be more active in order constantly to recreate and rebuild the social link. So our model is a very different one. (288)

So the concepts of entanglement and dis-entanglement describe the dynamics involved in reconfiguring entities and networks of entities. (294)
