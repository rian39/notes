I am defining corporealization as the interactions of humans and nonhumans in the distributed, heterogeneous work processes of technoscience. The nonhumans are both those made by humans, for example, machines and other tools, and those occurring independently of human manufacture. The work processes result in specific material-semiotic bodies – or natural-technical objects of knowledge and practice – such as cells, molecules, genes, organisms, viruses, ecosystems and the like. The work processes also make humans into particular kinds of subjects called scientists. The bodies are perfectly “real” and nothing about corporealization is “mere fiction.” 141-142

In a human being, the genome, or the full set of genes in the cell nucleus contained on chromosomes derived from both parents, contains about six billion pairs of DNA, representing copies from each parent of 50,000 to 100,000 genes plus a large amount of non-coding DNA. 148

genome  progressively signifies a historically new entity engendered by the productive identity crisis of nature and culture. The cultural productions of the genome produce a category crisis, a generic conumdrum in which proliferating ambiguities and chimeras animation the action in science, entertainment, domestic life, fashion, religion, and business. 148-9
