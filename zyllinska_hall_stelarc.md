When I talk about the obsolete body I don't mean that we should discard bodies altogether, but rather that a body with this form and these functions cannot operate effectively in the technological terrain that it has created. (Zylinska & Hall, 122)
Unfortunately, what often happens is that people are critiquing your work more from what you've written than what you're doing. Often they haven't actually seen a performance (116)
But I suspect we make very different metaphysical assumptions as to what we mean by the obsolete body. The body is obsolete in form and function. But we cannot operate disembodied. (121)
