Dewey, John. 1957. Reconstruction in Philosophy. 1st ed. Boston: Beacon Press.

Essential philosophic reconstruction represents an attempt to state these causes and results in a way freed from incompatible inherited factors. It will regard intelli gence not as the original shaper and final cause of things, but as the purposeful energetic re-shaper of those phases of nature and life that obstruct social well-being. 26 

If thought or intelligence is the means of intentional reconstruction of experience, then logic, as an account of the procedure of thought, is not purely formal. 135

Specific and wide observation of concrete fact always, then, corresponds not only with a sense of a problem or difficulty, but with some vague sense of the meaning of the difficulty, that is, of what it imports or signifies in subsequent experience. It is a kind of anticipation or prediction of what is coming. We speak, very truly, of impending trouble, and in observing the signs of what the trouble is, we are at the same time expecting, fore casting in short, framing an idea, becoming aware of meaning. When the trouble is not only impending but completely actual and present, we are overwhelmed. We do not think, but give way to depression. The kind of trouble that occasions thinking is that which is in complete and developing, and where what is found, already in existence can be employed as a sign from which to infer what is likely to come. When we intelli gently observe, we are, as we say apprehensive, as well as apprehending.68 

In the question of methods concerned with reconstruction of special situa tions rather than in any refinements in the general con cepts of institution, individuality, state, freedom, law, order, progress, etc., lies the true impact of philosophi cal reconstruction. 91 

What is needed is specific inquiries into a multitude of specific struc tures and interactions. Not only does the solemn reiteration of categories of individual and organic or social whole not further these definite and detailed in quiries, but it checks them. It detains thought within pompous and sonorous generalities wherein controversy is as inevitable as it is incapable of solution. It is true enough that if cells were not in vital interaction with one another, they could neither conflict nor co-operate. But the fact of the existence of an " organic " social group, instead of answering any questions merely marks the fact that questions exist: Just what conflicts and what co-operations occur, and what are their specific causes and consequences? 199 

Just as " individual " is not one thing, but is a blanket term for the immense variety of specific reactions, habits, dispositions and powers of human nature that are evoked, and confirmed under the influences of associated life, so with the term " social." Society is one word, but infinitely many things. It covers all the ways in which by associating together men share their experiences, and build up common interests and aims; street gangs, schools for burglary, clans, social cliques, trades unions, joint stock corporations, villages and international alliances. The new method takes effect in substituting inquiry into these specific, changing and relative facts (relative to problems and purposes, not metaphysically relative) for solemn manipulation of general notions.200 

Society, as was said, is many associations not a single organization. Society means association ; coming together in joint intercourse and action for the better realization of any form of experience which is augmented and confirmed by being shared. Hence there are as many associations as there are goods which are enhanced by being mutually communicated and participated in. And these are literally indefinite in number. 206 

The first distinguishing characteristic of thinking then is facing the facts – inquiry, minute and extensive scrutinizing, observation. 140

> Concrete things have _ways_ of acting, as many ways of acting as they points of interaction with other things. One thing is callous, unresponsive, inert in the presence of some other things; it is alert, eager and on the aggressive with respect to other things; in a third case, it is receptive, docile. 153 

>Organization is no more merely nominal or mental in any art, including the art of inquiry, than it is in a department store or railway system. 154

>[a classification] ... is rather a repertory of weapons for attack upon the future and the unknown. 154 

Experience becomes an affair primarily of doing. The organism does not stand about, Micawber- like, waiting for something to turn up. It does not wait passive and inert for something to impress itself upon it from without. The organism acts in accordance with its own structure, simple or complex, upon its surround ings. As a consequence the changes produced in the environment react upon the organism and its activities. The living creature undergoes, suffers, the consequences of its own behavior. This close connection between doing and suffering or undergoing forms what we call experience. 86
