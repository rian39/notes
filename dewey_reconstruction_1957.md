One thing is callous, unresponsive, inert in the presence of some other things; it is alert, eager and on the aggressive with respect to other things; in a third case, it is receptive, docile. 153 

>Organization is no more merely nominal or mental in any art, including the art of inquiry, than it is in a department store or railway system. 154

Experience becomes an affair primarily of doing. The organism does not stand about, Micawber- like, waiting for something to turn up. It does not wait passive and inert for something to impress itself upon it from without. The organism acts in accordance with its own structure, simple or complex, upon its surround ings. As a consequence the changes produced in the environment react upon the organism and its activities. The living creature undergoes, suffers, the consequences of its own behavior. This close connection between doing and suffering or undergoing forms what we call experience. 86
