The word 'network' describes a structural condition whereby distinct points (often called 'nodes') are related to one another by connections (often called 'ties') that are typically multiple, intersecting and often redundant. 2

The network society thesis is closely connected to the constellation of theories and analyses which arose in the 1980s under the banner of 'post-Fordism.' 10

Fordism, the accumulation regime which prevailed from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century 10

New communications technologies and industries (i.e. Broadcast radio and television) provided media through which a mass culture of consumption could be manufactured, and the quasi-scientific practices of opinion polling, market research and advertising provided means for management of the mass audience and market. 12

The role of the state under the post-Fordist regime of accumulation is essentially to provide the conditions for flexibility, innovation and competitiveness. 15

The phrase 'network society' applies to societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics. The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices.  ... the second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks  as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations. 26 {#network} {#platform-society}

At the economic base of the network society is an 'informational' – as opposed to strictly industrial – capitalist economy. 28
The principal source of conflict and resistance in the network society is the contradiction between the placeless character of networks and the rootedness of human meaning. 31
Perhaps digital networks are to human communications what automated bread-making machines are to the baking of bread. 47
Thinking through the essence of technology can reveal a great deal to us about our specific encounter with digital networks. 49
Indeed it is arguable that the tendency for technological designs to constitute political arrangements is most pronounced in the area of communications, a human practice that is indispensable to, and often definitive of, political life more generally. 50 (e.g. Lessig)
Thus, the priorities of commerce and security have combined to create a situation that is pushing the outcome of network technology in a particular direction. 57
It is arguable that the penetration of network technologies into workplaces, sites of production, the infrastructure of global commerce and the practice of warfare – in a phrase, their use as technologies of systems control  - will ultimately be more important to the shape of the network society that their use as technologies of interpersonal and mass communication. 60
time-space compression, deterritorialization, decentralization, interactivity and customization,  61-68
To the extent it exists as a discernible historical formation, the network society is an outgrowth of the operation of capitalist economies under the auspices of digital technologies. 69
Capitalism, then, is the major element of the context in which the development of network technoogy, and the society it mediates, is situated. 71
These include capitalist globalization; the rise of the so-called 'new economy'; network enterprises; non-standard forms of work and employment; and the status of property. 71
The network enterprise is thus a deterritorialized (though sometimes regionalized) network of networks of economic nodes, a formation whose architecture resembles that of the advanced digital communication technologies that make it possible. 84

Re production: In this respect, the network technologies of digitized bar-cdoe scanners at supermarket checkout and netowkr computer reservation systems in call centres are perhaps more significant, in material terms, than the technologies of online chat service, interactive entertainment websites, and electronic voting. 91
In some cases, digital technology often directly mediates the sort of non-standard work arrangements described above by enabling, for example, various spatially and temporally dislocated work practices and the delivery of 'lifelong learning'/retraining online. 99
[W]hile it is true that network technology can pose challenges for the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and that network media hold out the prospect of an economy in which information is non-proprietary and its circulation non-commercial, it is also true that capital has responded vigorously to these very challenges and prospects. 105
The new politics is thus a politics of struggling over information management and control in the 'space' constructed by prevailing media of communication, as a necessary precondition of access to more material forms of power. 122
Network technologies provide resources to both sides in this contest. 124
Even in countries where access to network technologies is relatively widespread, distinctly political uses of these instruments are the exception rather than the norm. 129
[N]etwork technologies might just as well serve to reinforce the undemocratic tendencies of contemporary mainstream politics, and perhaps even to undermine the possibility of their tranformatino in democractic directions. 135
It is possible that characterizations of the internet as a medium of extensive ostmodenr identity fabrication are exaggerated, insofar as they over-generalize acedotal evidnece of practices that are actually quite marginal in relation to the tendencies of mainstream internet use. 154
The internet is certain a mass medium in the sense that it reaches increasingly massive populations. However, it does not necessarily construct its users as a mass audience that pays attention to the same things at the same time. 172
The 'Network Society' is not just a descriptive name. It is also an elaborated discourse that, in purporting simply to describe a set of contemporary social dynamics, provides a script that sets out roles, norms, expectations and the terms of dialogue. 179
The distinction I am drawing here is between the network society thesis as a tool of investigation and interpretation, and the rhetoric of the Network Society as an ideological discourse that serves a performative, prescriptive function. 181
