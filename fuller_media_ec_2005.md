As a form of speculative writing, the inventory (the list of items and supplies required for an expedition, an experiment, to open up a laboratory) opens up the space of a system of objects arranging itself in composition with as yet unknown combinatorial materials. 14 {#list}

Elements in a paratactic list always open up into a matrix of immanent universes. Each of the elements in a list is hypotactically stacked in relation to the immanence of what it is next to, what it abuts to and differs from. Such hypotaxis is virtual, that is, for its actualization it demands power to the imagination. 14 {#list}

The fecundity of such writing is not found in adherence to the particular form itself. 15

Each compositional fragment, each item on the list … opens up into other permutational fields. 16
each element runs off as a gateway to another medial dimension, an array of processes; each of these is connected up in ways that block, tease out, evacuate, or mix and amplify potential in what they connect to. 110 {#list}
