This fact production is itself … never driven by conceptual advances alone but often requires enabling technological advances.  …. The development of subjects (as in technoscientific disciplines such as genomics) is, however, always already entwined with the configuration of subjects (as in disciplined agents). 19

The core theoretical argument of the book is that understanding biocapital involves analyzing the relationship between materiality and modes of abstraction that underlie the coemergences of new forms of life science with market regimes for the conduct of such science. … In doing so, for instance, marketing discourse, the hype and hope surrounding emergent technologies, the fetish of genetic determinism, and the belief in science, nation, and religion all constitute the assemblages of postgenomic life. 33

At some fundamental level, it does not matter whether the promissory visions of a biotech company are true or not, as long as they are credible. 115

hype cannot be opposed to reality, as is too easily done when hype is read cynically. Rather, hype is reality, or at least constitutes the discursive grounds on which reality unfolds. 116
Clearly, therefore, promissory visions have been much more than just a feature of the biotech industry: they have enabled it to exist. 126

The gap that opens up between promise and its realization is where events  occur, and where politics -speed and tactics-take over. If promissory visions have made the biotech industry possible, then they have also placed the risk that attends all drug development – in this case, the risk of not fulfilling one's promise – at the heart of the calculus of biotech.  126

Life, for biocapital, is a business plan 144

And yet I argue that it is this temporality – the different likely rates of realization of each of these genomic advances – that is the real issue and get elided. 152

new epistemic and technological assemblages such as genomics can only be understood through an analysis of the market frameworks within which they are emergent. 280
