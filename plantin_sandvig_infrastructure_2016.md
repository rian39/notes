In the following section, we analyze Facebook and Google as cases of this combined infrastructuralization of platforms and the platformization of infrastructures. 13

Viewed simultaneously as an infrastructure and platform, Facebook presents a disturbing image. As an infrastructure, Facebook is progressively expanding and embedding itself in our daily existence, taking over more and more functions formerly provided by other, less restrictive means. The API, as a gateway, transforms Facebook from a centrally controlled system into something more like a network of independently developed, yet seamlessly interconnected systems and services. As a proprietary, largely opaque platform, Facebook filters our daily communicative acts through a profit-extracting sieve, deploying its intimate view of users’ activities and relationships for the benefit of advertisers and others, who in turn provide further data 17  {#platformization} {#infrastructure}

But rather than presuppose the slow evolution and eventual stability plateau characteristic of physical, capital-intensive infrastructures, they might also take account of how rapidly “infrastructuralized platforms” have arisen in the digital age. Similarly, they might explore how information technology (IT) has helped to platformize even capital-intensive industries such as the transport of documents and goods; for example, FedEx and United Parcel Service (UPS) both grew mighty through relentless application of IT to logistics 21

The result has been what we called a “platformization of infrastructures.” At the same time, the rise of platform strategies in the computer industry, and later in “Web 2.0” systems and services, made possible an “infrastructuralization of platforms.” Google, Facebook, and a handful of other corporate giants have learned to exploit the power of platforms— which hold undeniable benefits for both users and smaller, independent application developers—to gain footholds as the modern-day equivalents of the railroad, telephone, and electric utility monopolies of the late 19th and the 20th centuries. 21 {#platformization}

We hope to foster scholarship describing conflicts or subductions between infrastructures and platforms across various sectors 22 {#platform-controversy}

This combined perspective, one might hope, would reassert the importance of widely available, universal, and relatively stable infrastructure as a foundation of social justice. 22 {#platform-positive}

It would recognize that the “system builders” that dominated infrastructures of the past may be replaced by “ecosystem-builders” that leverage programmability and interconnection to achieve control, rather than relying on direct provision and expansion.22 {#platform-ecosystem}a {#platform-making}
