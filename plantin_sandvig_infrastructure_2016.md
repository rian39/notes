But rather than presuppose the slow evolution and eventual stability plateau characteristic of physical, capital-intensive infrastructures, they might also take account of how rapidly “infrastructuralized platforms” have arisen in the digital age. Similarly, they might explore how information technology (IT) has helped to platformize even capital-intensive industries such as the transport of documents and goods; for example, FedEx and United Parcel
Service (UPS) both grew mighty through relentless application of IT to logistics 21

The result has been what we called a “platformization of infrastructures.” At the same time, the rise of platform strategies in the computer industry, and later in “Web 2.0” systems and services, made possible an “infrastructuralization of platforms.” Google, Facebook, and a handful of other corporate giants have learned to exploit the power of platforms— which hold undeniable benefits for both users and smaller, independent application developers—to gain footholds as the modern-day equivalents of the railroad, telephone, and electric utility monopolies of the late 19th and the 20th centuries. 21 

We hope to foster scholarship describing conflicts or subductions between infrastructures and platforms across various sectors 22

This combined perspective, one might hope, would reassert the importance of widely available, universal, and relatively stable infrastructure as a foundation of social justice. 22
