[A]ll societies have lived in and through the imagination. We can say that in every case the real would be 'hallucinated' (the object of individual or group hallucinations) if it were not symbolised, in other words collectively represented. 8
When the relationship to the world becomes congealed and virtualised, it removes identity from the test of alterity. It thus creates the conditions for solitude and is likely to engender an I that is just as artificial as the image it devises of others. 25
[T]he upper reaches of economic and technological development which take the planet it is totality as their field of action (in this regard a planet which is made uniform, treated as a market, an area for expansion, a site of competition or partnership) are usually those where different origins, languages and cultures co-exist in a quite spectular manner. 10
The question is more one of knowing  whether the development of technologies has released, especially as the work of those who use them for economic and political ends, a misdirected form of the imagination ('fictionalising') and with it a harmful energy of which they no longer have complete control and whose existence, in truth, they have not fully recognised.
