> key instrumentalities of speed—the core and “cutting edge” infrastructures from which contemporary experiences of speed and acceleration are held to flow—are for all that no less subject to the processes of reversal, ruin, and decline that characterize other forms of social and material existence in the world. For all their vaunted power and reach, transport, communication, and other infrastructures central to the acceleration of temporal experience from Marx’s time to our own remain in many ways light and fragile creatures, prone to the constant threat of failure and decay. Attending to breakdown points us toward the active and ontologically productive nature of ruin, and the irreducible presence of embedded materialities with rhythms and propensities all their own, which can only ever be sometimes, and for a while, slowed, arrested, and aligned. 173

>Like other global accounts, undifferentiated discussions of speed and acceleration risk missing the vast differences that mark and separate the temporal experiences of variously placed social actors. If “fast” is an affordance of our new technically mediated orders, it is not one available to all. 180
