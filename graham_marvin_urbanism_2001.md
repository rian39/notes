Graham, S. and S. Marvin (2001). Splintering urbanism : networked infrastructures, technological. London, Routledge.
A critical focus on networked infrastructure – transport, telecommunications, energy, water and streets – offers up a powerful and dynamic way of seeing contemporary cities and urban regions. ... When our analytical focus centres on how the wires, ducts, tunnels, conduits, streets, highways and technical networks that interlace and infuse cities are constructed and used, modern urbanism emerges as an extraordinarily complex and dynamic sociotechnical process.  Contemporary urban life is revealed as a ceaseless and mobile interplay between many different scales, from the body to the globe. Such mobile interactions across distances and between scales, mediated by telecommunications, transport, energy and water networks, are the driving connective forces of much-debated processes of 'globalisation'. (8)
How, then, can we imagine the massive technical systems that interlace, infuse and underpin cities and urban life? (8)
In a sense, then, the life and flux of cities and urban life can be considered to be what we might call a series of closely related 'sociotechnical processes'. These are the very essence of modernity: people and institutions enrol enormously complex technological systems (of which they often know very little) to extend unevenly their actions in time and space (10).
Finally, infrastructure networks, and the sociotechnical processes that surround them, are strongly involved in structuring and delineating the experiences of urban culture and what Raymond Williams (1973) termed the 'structures of feeling' of modern urban life. 
It argues that a parallel set of processes are under way within which infrastructure networks are being 'unbundled' in ways that help sustain the fragmentation of the social and material fabric of cities. Such a shift, which we label with the umbrella term splintering urbanism, requires a reconceptualisation of the relations between infrastructure services and the contemporary development of cities. 33
Much of the material and technological fabric of cities, then, is  networked infrastructure. At the same time, most of the infrastructural fabric is urban 'landscape' of various sorts. 13
