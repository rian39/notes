Deirdre Boden The Business of Talk Organizations in Action Polity Press 1994

Many of the large meetings studied here are primarily information  oriented whereas smaller informal meetings are, at least in spirit, decision focussed. This is not to say that many decisions are actually made in most meetings, but they are often nevertheless the focal point. In fact "decisions” - in the typical sense discussed in business and academic settings, indeed often with many diagrams and much hand-waving - are frequently invisible. It is instead the incremental process of decision-making that is the observable feature of so many organizational settings. 84

Making the organization “work” means supporting (not subverting) rules, policies and goals at the formal level through a constant process of considerable informality. It is in this sense, as I indicated at the outset of this study, that organizations operate in an informal mode all the time. They do so because they must. 192    
   
The essence of my position will  be to argue that we observe our social world, select among options, interpret ambiguity, make decisions, and take action together. That togetherness matters profoundly to what “decision-making" is or ever can be. 180

Past workplaces of industrial societies depended in large part on standardizing, simplifying, and not infrequently stifling individual flexibility in the interests of production efficiency and organizational effectiveness. Organizations of the future will essentially invert this trend . 210

Effective work settings and thus successful organizations will increasingly depend on local, decentered, on-the-spot decision-making. 210

Transforrnatlons and innovation in organizations occur at the intersection of information and interaction. That intersection is, as we have seen, finely organized and massively dependent on what might usefully be called a “just in time'" understandings of organizational agendas. Those In turn are developed not as abstract pseudo-rational goals but in the intense settings of everyday Interaction. Increasingly, people in organizations will have to move ahead with quick interpretations of rapidly changing  events. 210

Given the momentary attention spans of modern management and workers, successful organizations will be those that recognize and facilitate high levels of interaction and ready opportunities for quick contact. Locale on-the-spot decision-making and planning will be the key to this continuity of structure-in-action is sequence.22 

Action coheres as sequence. Through coherent sequences of coordination we discover the structuring quality of all social life. This structuring feeling comes from a multiplex mix of personal, physical and psychological features that give us an embodied sense of self, on the one hand, and from an interlocking set of social, spatial and societal sensibilities, on the other. 206

This again is the essence of the ethnomethodological position, namely that as social actors discover from within the local logic of their actions, they reflexively - which is to say, conscIously, interactively, and Indexically - locate those activities within a stream of events that, taken together, constitute the rational production of the organization. In so doing, the local logic of action creates and recreates the smooth and reasonable surface of organizational rationality. 198

People, as I have stressed, create practical structures, which they then treat as external, factual and real.180

Idealization is what the modern notion of rationality is based upon, and it is, almost by definition, unattainable. But much of the current debate over rational choice and rationality tends to ignore this. Instead, a single external and abstract rationality is assumed to guide action from above. 181

Much decision theory and the research based on it also depends on basic assumptions of rather singular rationality and the manner in which degrees of uncertainty of both environment and outcome influence the process of decision-making. 181

A central problem is that decision-making is incremental and fragmentary. Actual decisions in organizations are virtually invisible, yet they are the “quanta" out of which pivotal choices are made, undesirable strategies avoidedl and critical paths taken. The result is best described as that “drift of decision-making” suggested by March and hls colleagues, rather than the crisp, goal-oriented, value-maximizing assumptions of many theories of rational action. Decisions, as identifiable items, become clear only after their constitution. 183

[S]cientific standards for rationality require four basic elements:(1) a commitment to a means-ends relation as defined by formal logic; (2) semantic clarity and distinctness in defining a situation in which action is to be wakens as well as (3) an interest in clarity and rules of procedures for their own sake and not just the task at hand; and finally (4) a willingness to act according to a body of scientific knowledge 186

This mismatch between scientific and everyday rationalities results in the routine discovery that people do not follow such pure, general procedures when they make decisions about where to go to dinner or how to make revolution. 186

The unfolding logic of decisions-in-progress is dominated by a local focal point that is constantly shifting along a dynamic and often multidirectional time horizon. As social actors look over their shoulders at past actions and decisions, they also look sideways, fitting their current activities with parallel points and agents on their organizational landscape. Simultaneity is a critical contingency of action. Nor are these local relevancies of various aspects and stages of a decision-in-progress simply constrained by temporal contingencies; they are also constitutive of them, creating timeliness con-trollingl to a high degrees the practical enactment of organizational actions and even goals. 191

The persistent urge to deal with complex activities in face to-face settings means that space matters centrally to decision-making and to organizations in action.43 191
