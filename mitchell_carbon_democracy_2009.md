FOLLOW THE OIL – MAIN IDEA OF THE ARTICLE
 Understanding the relations between fossil
fuels and democracy requires tracing how these connections are built, the
vulnerabilities and opportunities they create and the narrow points of passage
where control is particularly effective.6  Political possibilities were opened up or
narrowed down by different ways of organizing the flow and concentration of
energy, and these possibilities were enhanced or limited by arrangements of
people, finance, expertise and violence that were assembled in relationship to
the distribution and control of energy. 401

2nd connnection between fuel & democracy: Great quantities of energy now flowed along very narrow channels. Large
numbers of workers had to be concentrated at the main junctions of these
channels. Their position and concentration gave them, at certain moments,
a new kind of political power. The power derived not just from the organizations
they formed, the ideas they began to share or the political alliances they
built, but from the extraordinary concentrations of carbon energy whose flow
they could now slow, disrupt or cut off. 403

 The second method of preventing energy abundance involved the rapid
construction of lifestyles in the United States organized around the consumption
of extraordinary quantities of energy. 409

 If the ability of organized workers to disrupt the networks and nodal points
of a coal-based energy system shaped the kinds of mass politics that emerged,
or threatened to emerge, in the first half of the twentieth century, this post-war
reorganization of fossil fuel networks altered the energetics of democracy. 409

 If the construction of new energy networks replacing coal with oil was the
basis for building a particular form of post-war democracy in Europe, those
networks had different political properties from the coal-centred energy
arrangements they replaced. Although the oilfields, pumping stations, pipelines
and refineries of the Middle East became sites of intense political struggle, they
did not offer those involved the same powers to paralyse energy systems and
build a more democratic order. 413 – FOLLOWS LONG DISCUSSION OF STRIKES AND DISRUPTION OF PUMPS, PIPELINES, ETC AND OTHER MILITANCY

 If the working of carbon fuel networks helped engender certain concentrations
of power and points of political vulnerability in the coal era, and these
were transformed with the post-war transition to oil into new sites of
democratic contestation and vulnerability, post-war democracy in Europe was
also built on international financial exchanges organized upon the flow of oil. 415 KEY POINT IF THIS STILL APPLIES TODAY?

 Like twentieth-century democracy, twentieth-century economic expertise
developed in a specific relationship to the hydrocarbon age. 416

 Larger connections can be drawn between the assembling of ‘the economy’
and the transition from a coal-based to a predominantly oil-based energy
system. The conception of the economy depended upon abundant and lowcost
energy supplies, making post-war Keynesian economics a form of
‘petroknowledge’. 417 – THERE IS ECONOMY BECAUSE OF OIL!

 Oil contributed to the new conception of the economy as an object that
could grow without limit in two ways. First, oil declined continuously in price.
Adjusting for inflation, the price of a barrel of oil in 1970 was one-third of
what it sold for in 1920.51  So, although increasing quantities of energy were
consumed, the cost of energy did not appear to represent a limit to growth.
Second, thanks to its relative abundance and the ease of shipping it across
oceans, oil could be treated as something inexhaustible. Its cost included no
calculation for the exhaustion of reserves. 418
 No
model of the economy or its future growth could rationalize such an
unprecedented transformation in costs of energy or flows of finance. But if
 419
 the world was reconfigured as a system of finite resources, rapidly running out,
then entirely new calculations became possible.
The need to conserve environmental resources and protect them for the
long term also helped with another calculation. For the oil companies, the large
increase in oil prices carried a risk. It threatened to make affordable a rival
source of energy, nuclear power. However, if the oil companies could force
producers of nuclear power to introduce into the price of the energy they sold
a payment to cover its long-term environmental effects  the cost of
decontaminating reactors when they went out of service and of storing spent
fuel for millennia  it would remain more expensive than oil. 420

 The role of oil companies in framing the politics of the environment
suggests another dimension of the relationship between oil and democracy:
compared to the production of coal, oil production has a different way of
deploying and distributing expertise. Earlier, I suggested that the democratic
militancy of coal-miners could be traced in part to the autonomy that miners
exercised at the coal face, especially prior to the large-scale mechanization of
production. The autonomy of those who mined the ore placed a significant
amount of expertise in their hands. Oil, in contrast, leaves its workers on the
surface and distributes more of the expertise of production into the offices of
managers and engineers. 421

 Exploring the properties of oil, the
networks along which it flowed, and the connections established between flows
of energy, finance and other objects provides a way of understanding how the
relations among these different elements and forces were constructed. The
relations we have followed connected energy and politics, materials and ideas,
humans and non-humans, calculations and the objects of calculation,
representations and forms of violence, and the present and the future. 422

 Democratic politics developed, thanks to oil, with a peculiar orientation
towards the future: the future was a limitless horizon of growth. This horizon
was not some natural reflection of a time of plenty. It was the result of
a particular way of organizing expert knowledge and its objects, in terms of
a novel world called ‘the economy’. 422

 in tracing the connections that were made between
pipelines and pumping stations, refineries and shipping routes, road systems
and automobile cultures, dollar flows and economic knowledge, weapons
experts and militarism, one discovers how a peculiar set of relations was
engineered among oil, violence, finance, expertise and democracy. 422
