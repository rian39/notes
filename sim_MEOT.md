Presentation written in 1958 by Gilbert Simondon

The book titled On the M ode o f Existence o f Technical O bjects aims at introducing
a knowledge into culture that is adequate to technical objects considered on three
levels: elements, individuals, ensembles. A gap manifests itself in our civilization
between the attitudes provoked in man by the technical object and the true nature
of these objects; from this inadequate and confused rapport a set of mythologi­
cal valuations and devaluations arises in the consumer, the manufacturer, and the
worker; in order to replace this inadequate rapport with a veritable relation, one

--


form just as an axiomatic saturates, each element fulfills not only a function in the
whole [ensem ble] but a function of the whole. There is something like a redundancy
of information in the technical object having become concrete.
This notion of information allows the general evolution of technical objects
to be interpreted via the succession of elements, of individuals and of ensembles,
according to the law of conservation of technicity. The veritable progress of tech­
nical objects takes place through a schema of relaxation and not of continuity:
there is a preservation throughout the successive cycles of evolution of technicity
as information.

xvi
The second phase envisions the rapport between man and the technical object,
on the one hand at the level of the individual, and on the other hand, at the level
of ensembles. The individual's mode of access to the technical object is m inor or
m ajor; the minor mode is the mode appropriate for the knowledge o f the tool or the
instrument; it is primitive, but adequate to this level of the existence of technicity
in the form of tools or instruments; it turns man into a bearer of tools, according
to a concrete apprenticeship, a sort o f instinctive symbiosis of man and the techni­

--

improvement of elements; the pessimistic and dramatic progress o f the 19th cen­
tury corresponds to the replacement o f the individual human tool bearer by the
machine individual, as well as corresponding to the anxiety resulting from the
frustration of this progress. Finally, what remains to be elaborated is a new notion
of progress corresponding to the discovery o f technics at the level of the ensembles
of our epoch, by virtue of a deepening of the theory o f information and communi­
cation: the true nature of man is not to be a tool bearer — and thus a competitor
of the machine, but man's nature is that o f the inventor of technical and living
objects capable of resolving problems of compatibility between machines within
an ensemble; he coordinates and organizes their mutual relation at the level o f
machines, between machines; more than simply governing them, he renders them
compatible, he is the agent and translator of information from machine to machine,
intervening within the margin o f indeterminacy harbored by the open machine's
way of functioning, which is capable of receiving information. Man constructs the

--

most primitive and the most elaborate of all thoughts, philosophical thought, that
a truly n eu tral and balan ced because complete, mediation between opposing phases
can intervene. It is thus p h ilosoph ical thought alone that can assume the knowl­
edge, valorization and completion of the phase of technicity within the entirety
[ensemble] of man’s modes of being in the world, by way of a meditation regarding
the rapport between science and technics, theology and mysticism.

responds not to an increase of automatism, but on the contrary to the fact that
the operation of a machine harbors a certain margin of indeterminacy. It is this
margin that allows the machine to be sensitive to outside information. Much more
than any increase in automatism, it is this sensitivity to information on the part of
machines that makes a technical ensemble possible. A purely automatic machine
completely closed in on itself in a predetermined way of operating would only be
capable of yielding perfunctory results. The machine endowed with a high degree
of technicity is an open machine, and all open machines taken together [l ’ensem ble
des m achines ouvertes] presuppose man as their permanent organizer, as the living

--

is what allows the same machine to extract cube roots or to translate a simple
text, composed of a small number of words and expressions, from one language
into another.
It is also through the intermediary o f this margin o f indeterminacy and not
through automatisms that machines can be grouped into coherent ensembles and
exchange information with one another via the intermediary of the coordinator
that is the human interpreter. Even when two machines exchange information
directly (as between a master oscillator and another pulse synchronized oscillator),
man intervenes as a being who regulates the margin of indeterminacy in order to

--

who would be like a sociologist or psychologist of machines, living in the midst of
this society of technical beings as its responsible and inventive consciousness.
A genuine awareness of technical realities, grasped in their signification, corre­
sponds to an open plurality of techniques. It cannot, moreover, be otherwise because
a technical ensemble, even one that is not very extensive, comprises machines whose
principles of operation are derived from very different scientific domains. So-called
“technical” specialization most often corresponds to matters that are, strictly
speaking, external to the technical objects (public relations, a particular form of
commerce), rather than corresponding to a kind of operational schema within the

--

nation that gives it its consistency at the end-point of a process of evolution, thus
proving that it cannot be considered as a mere utensil.
The modalities of this genesis enable one to grasp the three levels of the technical
object and their non-dialectical temporal coordination: the element, the individ­
ual, and the ensemble.
Once the technical object is defined through its genesis, it becomes possible to
study the relations between the technical object and other realities, in particular
that of man at the stage of adulthood or childhood.
Lastly, considered as an object of value judgment, the technical object can pro­

of the element, at the level of the individual, or at the level of the ensemble.
At the level of the element, the process of its improvement does not introduce any
upheavals that would engender anxiety by conflicting with acquired habits: this is
the climate of eighteenth century optimism, which introduces the idea of contin­
uous and indefinite progress, bringing about the constant improvement o f mans

--

does. To this phase corresponds a dramatic and impassioned notion of progress,
which turns into the rape of nature, the conquest o f the world, and the exploitation
of energies. This will to power expresses itself in the technophile and technocratic
excesses of the thermodynamic era, which take on both a prophetic and cataclys­
mic spin. Finally, at the level of the technical ensembles of the twentieth century,
this thermodynamic energeticism is replaced by information theory, whose content
is normative and eminently regulative and stabilizing: the development of technics
appears to be a guarantee of stability. The machine, as an element o f the techni­
cal ensemble, becomes that which increases the quantity of information, increases
negentropy, and opposes the degradation of energy: the machine, being a work of
organization and information, is, like life itself and together with life, that which
is opposed to disorder, to the leveling of all things tending to deprive the universe
of the power of change. The machine is that through which man fights against the

This modification of the philosophical way of looking at the technical object
announces the possibility of introducing the technical being into culture: this inte­
gration, which could not have taken place in a definitive way at the level of elements
or at the level of individuals, will have a greater chance of stability at the level of
ensembles; once technical reality has become regulative it can be integrated into
culture, which is regulative in its essence. This integration could only have occurred
by way of addition in the age when technicity resided in its elements, or by way
of a breach and a revolution in the age when technicity resided in new technical
individuals; today, technicity tends to reside in ensembles. For this reason, it can
become a foundation for culture, to which it will bring a unifying and stabilizing
power, making culture adequate to the reality which it expresses and regulates.

an imperfection, unless this exchange itself belongs to the theoretical operation;
furthermore there is a primitive form of the technical object, the abstract fo rm , in
which each theoretical and material unit is treated as an absolute, and is completed
according to an intrinsic perfection that requires, in order for it to function, that
it be constituted as a closed system; integration into an ensemble in this case raises
a series of so-called technical problems that must be resolved and which are in fact
problems of compatibility between already given ensembles.
These already given ensembles need to be maintained and preserved despite their
reciprocal influences. What appears then are particular structures that one can call,
for each constitutive unit, defense structures: the cylinder head of the thermal
combustion engine bristles with cooling fins that are particularly well developed
in the region of the valves, which is subject to intense thermal exchanges and high

--

heads fins by sawing or grinding, then the volumetric unit constituted by the
cylinder head alone would no longer be viable, even as a volumetric unit: it would
be deformed under the gaseous pressure; the volumetric and mechanical unit has
become coextensive with the unit o f thermal dissipation because the structure of
the ensemble is bivalent: the fins constitute a cooling surface of thermal exchanges
with the stream o f external air; these same fins, insofar as they are a part of the
cylinder head, limit the size o f the combustion chamber through their un-deformable contour, using less metal than would be required by a shell without ribs; the
development of this unique structure is not a compromise, but a concomitance
and a convergence: a ribbed cylinder head can afford to be thinner than a smooth

--

system of requirements.
Conversely, during the industrial stage, the object achieves its coherence and it
is the system of needs that is now less coherent than the system of the object; needs
mold themselves onto the industrial technical object, which in turn acquires the
power to shape a civilization. It is utilization that becomes an ensemble chiseled to

--

the theater of a certain number of reciprocal causal relations.
It is due to these relations, given certain limits of the conditions of utilization,
that the object encounters obstacles within its own operation: the play o f limits,
whose overcoming constitutes progress, resides in the incompatibilities that arise from
the progressive saturation o f the system o f sub-ensembles;1 yet because of its very nature,

this overcoming can occur only as a leap, as a modification of the internal distri­
bution of functions, a rearrangement of their system; what was once an obstacle2

with targeted beams is equivalent to a pentode; it is even superior in its function as
a power amplifier of acoustic frequencies, because of the lower degree of distortion
it produces. The adjunction of a supplementary structure only constitutes genuine
progress for the technical object if this structure incorporates itself concretely into
the totality [ensemble] o f dynamical schemas of functioning; for this reason we will
say that the tetrode with targeted beams is more concrete than the pentode.
One must not confuse the increase o f the concrete aspect of the technical object
with the increase o f the technical objects possibilities via a complication of its
structure; for instance, a twin-grid lamp (which allows separate action on two inde­

--

structural element fulfills several functions rather than a single one; but these two
processes are in fact tied to each other; differentiation is possible because, in a
conscious and calculated manner and in view of a necessary result, it enables the
integration of correlative effects of the global functioning into the functioning of
the ensemble, effects which had until then been more or less corrected by pallia­
tives that were separate from the principle function.
The same type of evolution is noticeable in the passage from the Crookes tube
to the Coolidge tube; the first is not only less efficient than the second; it is also
less stable in its functioning, and more complex; the Crookes tube in fact uses the

--

the groups o f synergetic functions are allocated to specific structures; each struc­
ture attains a greater functional wealth from this redistribution as well as a more
perfect structural precision; this is the case for the cathode, which, rather than
being a simple spherical cap or hemisphere made o f any kind o f metal, becomes
an ensemble consisting o f a parabolic bowl at the heart o f which there is a filament
producing thermo-electrons; the anode, which in the Crookes tube occupied an
indifferent position with respect to the cathode, converges geometrically with the
previous anticathode; the new anode-anticathode plays the two synergetic roles:
that of the production o f a potential difference with respect to the cathode (the role

--

constitutes the true sub-system in the technical object. It is because of this search
for synergies that the technical object's concretization can translate into an element
o f simplification; the concrete technical object is one that is no longer in conflict
with itself, one in which no side-effect is detrimental to the functioning of the
ensemble or left out of this functioning. In this manner and for this reason a func­
tion can be fulfilled by several synergistically associated structures in the technical
object that has become concrete, whereas in the primitive and abstract technical
object each structure is charged with the accomplishment of a definite function,
and generally only one. The essence of the technical objects concretization is the
organization of functional sub-ensembles within the total functioning; on the basis
of this principle one can understand in what sense the redistribution of functions
occurs in the network of different structures, both in the abstract technical object
and in the concrete technical object: each structure fulfills several functions; but
in the abstract technical object, it only fulfills one essential and positive function,

integrated into the functioning of the ensemble; in the concrete technical object,
all the functions fulfilled by the structure are positive, essential, and integrated
into the functioning o f the whole; the marginal consequences of the functioning,
eliminated or attenuated in the abstract technical object by corrective measures,
become stages or positive aspects in the concrete object; the schema of function­

Should one therefore consider the invention of the rotating anode to be a struc­
tural concretization of the Coolidge tube? — No, because it mostly plays the role
of diminishing an inconvenience that couldn’t be converted into a positive effect
of the overall functioning [fonctionnement d'ensemble]. The inconvenience of the
Coolidge tube, the residual aspect of antagonism that subsists in its functioning,
is the poor yield of its conversion of kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation;
this poor yield probably does not constitute a direct antagonism between func­
tions, but it does practically convert into a real antagonism; if the tungsten plate

phy tubes is currently on the order of several kilowatts.
In this sense, one can say that minor improvements obstruct major improve­
ments, because they may mask the technical objects true imperfections by
compensating for true antagonisms with an inessential artifice that is incompletely
integrated into the functioning of the ensemble; the danger of abstraction recurs
once again at the level of minor improvements; for instance, the Coolidge tube
with a rotating anode is less concrete than a tube with static cooling facilitated by
a copper bar and air cooling fins; if, for whatever reason, the rotation of the anode
stops during the tubes functioning, the point receiving the concentrated beam

or at least not fabricated in its totality; it is a certain regime of natural elements sur­
rounding the technical being, linked to a certain regime of elements that constitute
the technical being. The associated milieu mediates the relation between technical,
fabricated elements and natural elements, at the heart of which the technical being
functions. Such is the case of the ensemble constituted by oil and water moving in
and around the Guimbal turbine. This ensemble is concretized and individualized
by recurrent thermal exchanges that take place within it: the faster the turbine
spins, the more there is an increase in the heat generated by the generator through
magnetic losses and the Joule effect; but the faster the turbine spins, the greater
the increase in the turbulence of the oil around the rotor and that of the water

conditioning o f the present by the future, by that which is not yet. Such a futural
function is only rarely the work of chance; it requires putting into play a capacity
to organize the elements according to certain requirements which act as an ensem­
ble, as a directive value, and play the role of symbols representing the future
ensemble that does not yet exist. The unity of the future associated milieu, within
which the causal relations will be deployed that will enable the functioning of the
new technical object, is represented , it is p lay ed or acted out as much as a role can be
played in the absence of the true character, by way of the schemes of the creative
imagination. The dynamism of thought is the same as that of technical objects;

ings o f the system o f forms taken as an ensemble. Alienation is the break between
ground and forms in psychic life: the associated milieu no longer regulates the
dynamism o f forms. To date, the imagination has been poorly analyzed because
forms have been invested with the privilege o f being active and are thought to have
the initiative in psychic life and in physical life. In reality there exists a great kin­

The technical objects principle of individualization through recurrent causality
within an associated milieu enables us to think with greater clarity about certain
technical ensembles and to know whether to treat them as a technical individual
or as a collection of organized individuals. We shall speak of a technical individual
whenever the associated milieu exists as a condition of functioning sin e q u a non ,
whereas it is an ensemble in the contrary case. Take a laboratory, such as a labora­
tory studying the physiology o f sensation. Is an audiometer a technical individual?
No, not if one considers it independently of the power supply and headphones
or speakers used as electro-acoustic transducers. The audiometer is defined, then,
by certain requisite conditions of temperature, voltage, and noise levels, so that

--

for the audiometer to operate properly it requires either a flat and barren land­
scape, or that its measurements be made in an anechoic chamber, with a suspended
anti-microphonic floor and a thick layer of glass-wool on the walls. What then is
the audiometer in itself, such as it is sold by a manufacturer or such as one makes
oneself? It is an ensemble of technical forms, wherein each has a relative indi­
viduality; in general it has two high-frequency oscillators, where one is fixed and
the other variable; the lower of the two frequency beats serves to produce audible
sound; a fader facilitates the dosage of the intensity of the stimuli. Neither of these
oscillators constitutes a technical object in itself, because in order for it to be stable

--

to be conditioned by the natural and technical external milieu; this milieu would
become a truly associated milieu only if a random drift in frequency in one of the
oscillators were, as a consequence, to entail variation in the supply voltage oppos­
ing this frequency drift; there would be an exchange through reciprocal causality
between regulated supply and the oscillators; it is the ensemble of technical struc­
tures that would thereby be self-stabilized; here, on the contrary, only the supply
is self-stabilized and it does not react upon random variations in the frequency of
one of the oscillators.


--

another rather than resulting in a regulatory reaction; the structures attached to
the same associated milieu have to function synergistically. For this very reason the
audiometer comprises at least two distinct parts that cannot be stabilized by the
same associated milieu: the frequency generator on the one hand and the ampli­
fier-fader on the other. An action by one of these ensembles on the other must be
avoided, which notably leads to the careful separation of both their power supplies
and to electrically and magnetically shielding the partition that separates them,
in order to avoid any interaction. The material limit of the audiometer, however,
is not a functional limit; the amplifier-fader is normally extended by way of the
acoustic transducer and by the room or external ear of the subject, depending on
whether or not one employs speakers or headphones for coupling with the subject.
Henceforth, one can posit the existence of relative levels of individualization of
technical objects. This criterion has an axio lo gical value : the coherence of a technical
ensemble is at its maximum when this ensemble is constituted by sub-ensembles
with the same level of relative individualization. In a laboratory of physiology of
sensations there is thus no advantage in grouping the audiometers two oscillators
together with the amplifier-fader; however, it is worth grouping the two oscillators
together so that both are affected simultaneously and in equal proportion by any

--

65

the amplifier-fader is plugged into, so as to avoid any reaction of variations in the
amplifiers anodic consumption of the oscillators’ power supply.
The principle of individualization of technical objects in an ensemble is thus one
of the sub-ensembles with recurrent causality in an associated milieu; all technical
objects having recurrent causality within their associated milieu must be separated
from one another and connected in such a way as to maintain the independence of
these associated milieus from one another. The sub-ensemble of oscillators and that
of the amplifier-fader-transducer must therefore be more than simply independent
in terms of power supply, they must also be independent in terms of coupling to
each other: amplifier input should be of very high impedance in relation to the
oscillators’ output, so as to ensure that any reaction of the amplifier on the oscilla­
tors is very weak. If one were, for instance, to plug the fader directly into the outlet
of the oscillators, then the setting of this fader might react on the frequency of the
oscillators. An ensemble of a higher degree comprising all these sub-ensembles
is defined by the capacity to freely realize any form of relation, without thereby
destroying the autonomy of individualized sub-ensembles. This for instance is the
role of a general power switchboard and wiring-board in a laboratory; electrostatic
and electromagnetic shields, the use o f non-reactive coupling such as what we call
the cathode-follow er, aim at maintaining the independence of these sub-ensembles,
while also allowing for the diverse combinations among the functioning o f sub-en­
sembles that are necessary; such is the second degree of the functional role of the
ensemble that one can call a laboratory, namely the utilization of the results of
functioning without any interaction with the conditions of functioning.
We might ask then, on what level is the individuality found: at the level of
the sub-ensemble or at that of the ensemble? The answer lies, as always, in the
criterion of recurrent causality. At the level of the higher ensemble (such as that
of the laboratory) there is indeed no truly associated milieu; if it exists, then it
does so only in certain respects, and it is not a general milieu; the presence of
oscillators in the room where the experiment in audiometry takes place is often
problematic; if the oscillators use transformers with an iron magnetic circuit, then

--

undesirable sound; an oscillator with resistances and capacities also emits a slight
sound due to alternative electrical attractions. For fine-tuned experiments it is nec­
essary to place the devices in another room and to operate them by remote control,
or to isolate the subject in an anechoic chamber. The same applies to the magnetic
radiation of power transformers, which can be very problematic in electro-encephalographic and electrocardiogiaphic experiments. A superior ensemble such as a

66

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

laboratory is thus above all constituted by un-coupling devices, in order to avoid
creating associated milieus by accident. The ensemble distinguishes itself from
technical individuals in the sense that the creation of a unique associated milieu is
undesirable; the ensemble is comprised of a certain number of devices in order to
counteract this possible creation of a unique associated milieu. It avoids internal
concretization of the technical objects it contains, and uses only the results of their
functioning, without allowing any interaction with their conditioning.
Are there other groupings with a certain individuality below the level of tech­

magnetic field produced an orientation of the molecules in the molten mass, an
orientation that maintains itself after cooling, if the magnetic field is sustained
during its cooling and transition into the solid state. Now, the furnace, the melting
pot, and the coils creating the magnetic field all together constitute a system that
is a technical ensemble; the heat of the furnace shouldn’t have an impact on the
coils, the induction field creating the heat in the molten mass shouldn’t neutralize
the continuous field aimed at bringing about the magnetization. This technical
ensemble is itself constituted of a certain number of technical individuals that are
organized in relation to each other, both in view of the result of their functioning
and so as to prevent the conditioning of each particular functioning from being
disturbed. In the evolution of technical objects we thus witness a passage of causal­
ity proceeding from prior ensembles to subsequent elements; such elements, once
introduced into an individual whose characteristics they modify, in turn enable
technical causality to rise from the level of the element to that of the individual,
then from the level of the individual to the level of the ensemble; here, in a new
cycle, technical causality once more descends to the level of the element via the
process of fabrication, where it reincarnates itself in new individuals and then in
new ensembles. There is thus a lineage of causality that is not rectilinear but ser­
rated, where one and the same reality exists first in the form of an element, then as
the characteristic of an individual and finally as the characteristic of an ensemble.

apply itself with ample variations of the engine torque to highly varied profiles,
at the cost of a loss of efficiency only in high power regimes (where the time of
admission is almost equal to the totality of the expansion stroke), makes thermal
energy easily adaptable to traction on rails. Stephenson’s valve gear and tubular
boiler, which are elements that emerge from the artisanal ensemble of the eigh­
teenth century, enter into the new individuals of the nineteenth century, especially
through the form of the locomotive. High tonnage transportation, which had now
become possible throughout all regions, and which was no longer constrained to
the contour lines and meandering of navigable tracks, led to the industrial concen­
tration of the nineteenth century, which not only incorporates individuals whose
functioning principle is based on thermodynamics, but is essentially thermody­
namic in its structures; it is therefore around coal sources of thermal energy and
close to the sites of the greatest deployment of thermal energy (coal mines and
iron works) that the great nineteenth-century industrial ensembles, at the peak
of their reign, are concentrated. We have gone from the thermodynamic element
to the thermodynamic individual and from the thermodynamic individual to the
thermodynamic ensemble.
The principal aspects of electrotechnics will in turn emerge as elements pro­
duced by these thermodynamic ensembles. Before acquiring their autonomy, the
applications of electrical energy emerge as highly flexible means for the transmis­
sion of energy from one place to another by way of energy transport cables. Metals
with high magnetic permeability are elements that are produced by way of the
application of thermodynamics to metallurgy. Copper cables and high resistance

direct current of early energy transport gives way to alternative currents with con­
stant frequency, adapted to being produced by thermal turbine and consequently
also being produced by hydraulic turbine. These electrotechnic individuals have
integrated themselves into the ensembles of the production, distribution and utili­
zation of electric energy, whose structure differs vastly from that of thermodynamic
concentrations. The role played by the railway in this thermodynamic concentra­
tion is now replaced by the role played by high voltage transmission lines in the
ensemble of industrial electricity.

sibility, afforded by electrical metallurgy, of extracting metals like silicon, which
allows the transformation o f the radiant energy of light into electrical current, with
an efficiency that already reaches a level relevant for limited applications (6%),
and which is not much lower than that of the first steam engines. A pure silicon
photo-cell, produced by large industrial electrotechnical ensembles, is the element
that hasn’t yet been incorporated into a technical individual; it is still only an
object of curiosity situated at the extreme end o f the technical possibilities of the
electro-metallurgic industry, but it is possible that it may become the point of
departure for a new phase o f development, analogous to the one we have experi­

--

progress, because it prevents the transmission, in the form of technical elements, of
what an age has acquired to the one that follows.
For progress to exist, each age must be able to pass on to the next age the fruit
borne of its technical effort; what is capable of being passed on from one age to
another are neither technical ensembles, nor even individuals, but the elements
that these individuals, grouped as ensembles, were able to produce; thanks to their
capacity of internal inter-commutation, technical ensembles in fact have the pos­
sibility of going beyond themselves by producing elements that differ from their
own. Technical beings are different from living beings in many respects, but they
differ essentially in the following respects: a living being engenders beings that
are similar to itself, or that can become so after a certain number of successive

which the technical ensemble had arrived at, and which, in turn, can be reunited
to enable the construction o f new technical beings in the form of individuals; there
is thus no engendering here, no procession or direct production, but only indirect
production through the constitution of elements that contain a certain degree of
technical perfection.

well crafted. In practical terms an adze can be in poor condition, blunt, and yet not
be a bad tool; an adze is a good tool if, on the one hand, it has a curve suited for a
straight, well aimed strike at the wood, and, on the other hand, if it can be sharp­
ened and keep its sharpness even when employed to work on hard wood. This latter
quality in turn results from the technical ensemble employed to produce the tool.
It is because it is a fabricated element that the adze can be made of a metal whose
composition varies at different points; this tool is not only a hunk of metal shaped
into a certain form; it has been forged, which is to say that the molecular chains
of the metal have a certain orientation that varies in certain places, like a piece of

--

was made of a plurality of functionally different zones, welded together. The tool
is made not only of form and matter; it is made of elaborate technical elements
according to a certain schema of functioning and assembled into a stable structure
through the operation of fabrication. The tool unites within itself the results of
the functioning of a technical ensemble. In order to make a good adze a technical
ensemble of a foundry, forge, and quench hardening is required.
The technicity of the object is thus more than a quality of its use; it is that which,
within it, adds itself to a first determination given by the relation between form and
matter; it acts as an intermediary between form and matter, here for instance as the
progressive heterogeneity of the quench hardening in different points. Technicity

73

was this concretization that gave Toledo’s blades their value and prestige, and more
recently, led to the quality of Saint-Etienne s steel. These types of steel express the
result of the functioning of a technical ensemble comprising in equal measure the
qualities of coal used, as well as the temperature and chemical composition of the
soft water of the Furan river, or the species of green wood used to stir and refine the
molten metal prior to casting. In certain cases, technicity becomes predominant
with respect to the abstract aspects of the relation between matter and form. A coil
spring is thus a very simple thing in form and matter, yet the fabrication of springs
requires a high degree of perfection in the technical ensemble that produces them.
The quality of individuals, such as an engine or an amplifier, often depends much
more on the technicity of simple elements (valve springs, for instance, or a modu­
lation transformer) than on the ingenuity o f their assembly. Technical assemblies,
however, that are capable of producing certain simple elements, such as a spring or

--

ation to say that the quality of a simple needle expresses the degree o f perfection
of a nations industry. This explains why there are judgments that are legitimate
enough in both practical and technical terms, such as when a needle is specifically
called an “English needle.” Such judgments have a practical sense, because techni­
cal ensembles express themselves in the simplest elements they produce. This mode
of thought of course exists for other reasons besides those that legitimate it, and
particularly because it is easier to qualify a technical object by its origin than to
judge its intrinsic value; what we have here is a phenomenon of opinion; but even
if this phenomenon gives rise to numerous exaggerations or intentional exploita­
tion, it is not without foundation.
Technicity can be considered a positive aspect o f the element, analogous to
the self-regulation exerted by the associated milieu in the technical individual.
Concretization is technicity at the level of the element; it is the reason why the ele­
ment is really an element produced by an ensemble, rather than being an ensemble
itself or an individual; this characteristic makes it detachable from the ensemble
and frees it so that new individuals may be constituted. There is of course no
peremptory reason why one would attribute technicity only to the element; the
associated milieu is the depositary of technicity at the level of the individual, just
as extension is the depositary of inter-commutativity at the level of the ensemble;
it is nevertheless good to reserve the term technicity for this quality of the element,
which expresses and preserves what has been acquired via a technical ensemble so as
to be transported into a new period. What the element transports is a concretized

74

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

technical reality, whereas the individual and the ensemble contain this technical
reality without being able to transport and transmit it; elements have a transduc­
tive property that makes them the true bearers of technicity, just as seeds transport
the properties of a species and go on to make new individuals. It is thus within
elements that technicity exists in the purest way, in a free state as it were, whereas
in the individual or the ensemble, technicity only exists in a state of combination.
However, this technicity, borne by the elements, contains no negativity, and no
negative conditioning intervenes in the moment of production of elements by the
ensembles or of individuals by invention, which reunites the elements in order to
form individuals. Invention, which is a creation of the individual, presupposes in
the inventor the intuitive knowledge of the element s technicity; invention occurs
at this intermediate level between the concrete and the abstract, which is the level
of schemas, and presupposes the pre-existence and coherence of representations

--

technical, with respect to which an individual being is discovered as that which
is susceptible to incorporating them. The compatibility of elements in a technical
individual presupposes the associated milieu: the technical individual must there­
fore be imagined, which is to say presupposed as already being constructed in
the form of an ensemble of ordered technical schemas; the individual is a stable
system of the technicities of elements organized as an ensemble. What is organized
are these technicities, as well as the elements as basis of these technicities, not
the elements themselves taken in their materiality. An engine is an assemblage of
springs, axes, and volumetric systems, each defined by their characteristics and
their technicity, not by their materiality; thus, a relative indeterminacy can subsist

is equally safe to deploy in a dry atmosphere. Therefore, in many cases, economic
considerations do not intervene directly, but through the repercussions that the
degree o f concretization of the technical object has on its deployment in an indi­
vidual ensemble. It is the general formula of the individual that is subjected to
economic repercussions, not that of the element as element. The liaison between
the technical and the economic domains occurs at the level of the individual or the
ensemble, but very rarely at the level of the element; in this sense, one could say
that technical value is largely independent of economic value and that it can be
appreciated according to independent criteria.
This transmission of technicity by its elements is what grounds the possibil­
ity of technical progress, above and beyond the apparent discontinuity of forms,

--

progress is all the more certain as each stage tends increasingly and more perfectly
toward a state of sole beneficiary.
The technical object is not directly a historical object: it is subject to the course
of time only as a vehicle of technicity, according to a transductive role that it plays
with respect to a prior age. Neither the technical ensembles nor technical individ­
uals remain; only elements have the power to transmit technicity from one age
to another, in the form of an effectuated, accomplished, materialized result. For
this reason it is legitimate to analyze the technical object as consisting of technical
individuals; but it is necessary to stress that at certain moments in its evolution
the technical element makes sense in itself, and is thus a depositary of technicity.
In light of this, one can establish the foundation of the analysis of the technics of
a human group through the analysis of elements produced by its individuals and
its ensembles: often these elements alone have the power to survive the downfall
of a civilization, and remain valid witnesses of a state of technical development. In
this sense, the method of ethnologists is perfectly valid; but one could prolong its
application by equally analyzing the elements produced by industrial techniques.
Indeed, there is no fundamental difference between a people who have no indus­
try and those who have a well-developed industry. Even in a people without any
industrial development, technical individuals and technical ensembles exist; never­
theless, rather than being stabilized by institutions that fix and perpetuate them by
installing them, these individuals and ensembles are temporary or even occasional;
what is preserved from one technical operation to another are merely the elements,
which is to say tools or certain fabricated objects. To build a boat is an operation
that requires a truly technical ensemble: a fairly flat ground, yet close to the water,

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

sheltered yet luminous, with supports and wedges to keep the ship standing while
it is being built. The shipyard, like the technical ensemble, can be temporary: it is
no less a shipyard constituting an ensemble. Even today similar temporary techni­
cal ensembles still exist, sometimes even highly developed and complex ones, such
as the construction sites of buildings; others are provisional while being durable,
like mining facilities or the drilling rigs for oil exploration.
Not all technical ensembles necessarily take on the stable form of the factory or
the workshop. On the other hand it seems that non-industrial civilizations differ­
entiate themselves from ours mostly by the absence of technical individuals. This is
true only if what is meant is that technical individuals do not exist materially in a
stable and permanent way; the function of technical individualization, however, is

--

himself technically; it is he who becomes the associated milieu of these diverse
tools; when he masters all of his tools, when he recognizes the moment he must
change tools in order to continue working or to use two or three tools at a time, he
ensures an internal distribution and self-regulation o f the task9 through his body.
In some cases, the integration in the ensemble of technical individuals happens via
the intermediary of an association of human individuals working in twos, in threes,
or in larger groups; when these groupings do not introduce functional differenti­
ation, then their only direct purpose is to increase the available energy or speed of
the work, but when differentiation is called for, they clearly demonstrate the gen­
esis of an ensemble on the basis of men employed as technical individuals rather
than as human individuals: this was the case with bow drilling, as described by the
authors of classical antiquity; it is still the case with the felling of certain trees; it
was also commonly the case, not so long ago, with the use of a two-man cross-cut
saw to make planks or rafters; two men working together in an alternating rhythm.

--

and even when they function in a way that produces comparable results, it is very
rare that they use procedures identical to the work of an individual man. The
analogy is in fact most often very external. Yet if man often feels frustration before
the machine, it is because the machine functionally replaces him as an individual:
the machine replaces man as tool bearer. In the technical ensembles of industrial
civilizations, jobs where several men must work in narrow synchronization are
becoming rarer than in a past characterized by the artisanal level. Conversely, at
the artisanal level, it is very frequent that certain works require the grouping of
human individuals with complementary functions: to shoe a horse, one man is

--

machine, the tool bearer; he realizes groupings of machines, but does not him­
self bear tools; indeed, the machine accomplishes the core work, the work of the
blacksmith and not that o f the helper; man, disengaged from this function of the
technical individual, which is the very essence of the artisanal function, can now
become either organizer o f the ensemble o f technical individuals, or helper of tech­
nical individuals: he greases, cleans, removes detritus and burrs, in other words, in
some respects he plays an auxiliary role; he provides the machine with elements,
changing the belt, sharpening the drill or the lathe cutting tool. There is thus, in
this sense, a role above that of the technical individuality, and one below it: servant
and regulator, he supervises the machine, the technical individual, by looking after
the relation of the machine with the elements and the ensemble; he is the organizer
of relations between technical levels, rather than being himself, like the craftsman,
one of the technical levels. A technician therefore adheres less to his professional
specialization than does a craftsman.
This nevertheless does not mean that man cannot be a technical individual in

--

asymmetrical conductivity, in particular within its rectifier function: it then enters
a phase of positive reaction. Allowing it the proper time to cool enables it to return
to its normal functioning.
Thus, man can intervene as a substitute for the technical individual, and connect
elements with ensembles, in an age when the construction of technical individuals
is not possible.
What one must take into account when thinking about the consequences of
technical development in relation to the evolution of human societies, is first
and foremost the process of the individualization of technical objects; human
individuality is increasingly disengaged from the technical function through the
construction o f technical individuals; for man, the functions that remain are both
below and above the role of tool bearer, oriented both toward the relation with
elements and toward the relation with ensembles. However, as it was precisely the
individuality of man that was once employed in technical work, and which had to
technicize itself because the machine couldn’t, it became customary to give each
human individual just one function in regard to work; this functional monism was
perfectly useful and necessary when man became a technical individual. But it now
creates unease, because man, who still seeks to be a technical individual, no longer
has a stable place alongside the machine: he becomes the servant of the machine
or the organizer of the technical ensemble; yet, in order for the human function
to make sense, it is necessary for every man employed with a technical task to
surround the machine both from above and from below, to have an understand­
ing of it in some way, and to look after its elements as well as its integration into
the functional ensemble. For it is a mistake to establish a hierarchical distinction
between the care given to elements and the care given to ensembles. Technicity
is not a reality that can be hierarchized; it exists as a whole inside its elements
and propagates transductively throughout the technical individual and ensembles:
through the individuals, ensembles are made of elements, and from them elements
issue forth. The apparent pre-eminence of ensembles comes from the fact that
ensembles are currently given the same prerogatives as those of people playing
the role of the boss. Yet ensembles are not in fact individuals; the devaluation of
elements equally results from the fact that the use of elements has hitherto been

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY


--

proper to helpers and that these elements were not very elaborate. The unease of
this situation relating to man and machine thus comes from the fact that one o f the
technical roles, that of the individual, has thus far and until this day been played
by men; no longer a technical being, man is, henceforth obliged to learn a new
function and to find a place within the technical ensemble that no longer corre­
sponds to the technical individual; the first movement consists in occupying two
functions that are not individual, that of elements and that of the direction o f the
ensemble; yet in these two functions man finds himself to be in conflict with the
memory of himself: man has for so long played the role of the technical individual
that the machine, once it has become a technical individual, still appears like a man
occupying the place of another man, when it is, on the contrary, man who in fact
provisionally replaced the machine before truly technical individuals could emerge.

11. Today man follows a strong tendency that drives him to behave like a tool-bearing machine, because for many centuries
prior to the creation o f machines he fulfilled this function, at a time when technical elements existed, in the form o f tools,
and technical ensembles existed in the form o f workshops or building sites, but not as technical individuals in the form o f
machines.

Man no longer needs a universalizing liberation, but a mediation. The new
magic will not be found in a direct expression o f the individual power to act,
assured by the knowledge that gives each gesture effective certainty, but in the
rationalization of forces that situate man by giving him meaning within a human
and natural ensemble. The very fact that teleology is treated as a knowable mech­
anism that is not definitively mysterious is indicative of the attempt not to accept
a situation as one simply lives it and is subjected to it. Rather than seeking the
procedure for the fabrication of objects without making a pact with matter, man
frees himself from his situation of being enslaved by the finality of the whole, by

--

suffering through it in resignation. Human society, in knowing its own teleological
mechanisms, is the result of conscious human thought, and consequently incorpo­
rates those who create it; it is the product of a human effort of organization, and
12. In past centuries, an important cause of alienation lay in the fact that the human being lent his biological individuality
to technical organization: he was bearer o f tools; technical ensembles could establish themselves only by incorporating man
as tool bearer. The deforming aspect o f the profession was at once psychic and somatic. The tool bearer was deformed by the
usage of tools. Professional somatic deformations have become rare in the present day. In the repugnance felt by the gentle­
man [l ’honnête homme] toward men of the trade, there is perhaps a part o f the unpleasant feeling that one has when seeing
a monstrosity. Todays occupational hazards are minimal with respect to professional deformations of the past. For Plato the

and values lived at the level of intuition. The manual laborer lives according to the
order of simultaneity; he is an autodidact when he wants to gain access to a culture.
It is according to this same difference between schematisms that the man of the
countryside is opposed to the city dweller. The man of the countryside is contem­
porary with a set [ensemble] of requirements and participations that make him a
being who is integrated into a natural system of existence; his tendencies and his
intuitions are the links of this integration. The city dweller is an individual being,
linked to a social coming-into-being rather than to a natural order. He is the oppo­
site of the man of the countryside in the way that an abstract and cultivated being is

--

roused by the discovery of the technicity of the elements. Machines are not, in
fact, directly considered automata by the encyclopedists; rather, they are consid­
ered an assemblage of elementary devices. Diderot’s collaborators directed their
attention essentially to the organs of machines. In the eighteenth century, the tech­
nical ensemble was still at the scale of the cork cutter’s workshop or that of the
scale maker’s; this ensemble links up with technical elements through the inter­
mediary of the craftsman who uses tools or machine-tools, rather than through
the intermediary of veritable technical individuals. The division of subjects for
study is consequently made according to rubrics of utilization and not according to
schemas of technics, i.e., according to types of machines; the principle in grouping

--

of the machine. Very different trades, however, can make use of identical or almost
identical tools. This principle of grouping thus leads to a certain superfluity of the
presentation of tools and instruments which, from one illustration to the next, can
be closely related forms.
The principle of grouping according to technical ensembles comprised of an
indefinite plurality of elements, however, is linked very closely to the idea of con­
tinuous progress such as it existed for the Encyclopedists. It is when technicity is

--

century; from this comparison between the same elements made in the seventeenth
and in the eighteenth century arose the idea o f the continuity of progress as a
forward march in what we have called the concretization of technical objects. The
evolution of this element, which takes place within already constituted technical
ensembles, does not provoke any upheaval: it improves the results of fabrication
without brutality, and authorizes the craftsman to preserve habitual methods,
while experiencing the feeling of facilitation at work; the habitual gestures, better
served by more precise instruments, now yield better results. The optimism of the
eighteenth century is to a large extent based on the elementary and continuous

--

left the human being intact because the human individual remained a technical
individual among his tools of which he was both the center and bearer. It is not
necessarily through its size that the factory distinguishes itself from the craftsmans
workshop, but through the change in relation between the technical object and
the human being: the factory is a technical ensemble that is comprised of auto­
matic machines, whose activity is parallel to that of human activity; the factory
uses true technical individuals, whereas, in the workshop, it is man who lends his
individuality to the accomplishment of technical actions. From then on the most
positive, most direct aspect, of the first notion of progress, is no longer experienced

--

the nineteenth century can no longer be experienced by the individual, because
it is no longer centralized with the individual as the center of command and per­
ception in the adapted action. The individual becomes the mere spectator of the
results of the functioning o f the machines, or the one who is responsible for the
organization of technical ensembles putting the machines to work. This is why
the notion of progress splits in two, becomes aggressive, ambivalent, and a source
of anxiety; progress is at a remove from man and no longer makes sense for the
individual, because the conditions of the individuals intuitive perception of prog­
ress no longer exist; this implicit judgment, which is very close to that of kinesthetic

--

junction of the conditions for the intellection of progress and for the experience of
the internal rhythms of work resulting from this same progress. Nineteenth cen­
tury man does not experience progress as a worker: he experiences it as an engineer
or a user. In fact, the engineer,14 the man of the machine, becomes the organizer of
the ensemble made up of workers and machines. Progress is grasped as a movement
that manifests itself through its results, rather than as progress in itself understood
as the ensemble of operations that constitute it, as the elements that actualize it,
and as being valid for a large number of people that would be coextensive with
humanity.

Destinées [Destinies] is to accept living within this moment of technical evolution.
Vigny made it accurate and significant by understanding that technical evolution
could not satisfy itself by way of itself, that it couldn’t simply close in on itself.
A third aspect of the notion of technical progress emerges with the repercussions
of the internal regulation of technical individuals regarding technical ensembles,
and, through these, regarding humanity. The second stage, that which corresponds
to the arrival of a new wave of technics at the level o f individuals, was character­
ized by the ambivalence of progress, by dual situation of man with regard to the
machine, and by the production of alienation. This alienation grasped by Marxism

--

dialectic in order to account for the existence of alienation within the proprietor
class. The relation of property with respect to the machine contains as much alien­
ation as the relation o f non-property, even if it corresponds to a very different
social state. On either side of the machine, above and below, the worker, who is a
man of elements, and the industrial boss, who is a man of ensembles, both lack a
true relation with the individualized technical object in the form of the machine.
Labor and capital are two modes of being where one is as incomplete as the other
with respect to the technical object and the technicity contained in industrial orga­
nization. Their apparent symmetry does not at all mean that the union of capital

--

respect to labor, with respect to the contact with the world (as in the master/slave
dialectic), but rather with respect to the technical object; the same goes for labor;
what labor lacks is not what capital possesses, and what capital lacks is not what
labor possesses. Labor possesses the intelligence of elements, capital possesses the
intelligence o f ensembles; but it is not by combining the intelligence of elements
with the intelligence of ensembles that one can arrive at the intelligence of the
interm ediary a n d non m ixed being that is the technical individual. Element, indi­
vidual, and ensemble follow each other along a temporal line; the man of the
element is late with respect to the individual; but the man of ensembles who has
not understood the individual is in no way ahead of his time with respect to it;
he tries to enclose the present technical individual in the structure of an ensemble
belonging to the past. Labor and capital are both late with respect to the technical
individual that is a depository of technicity. The technical individual is not of the
same era as the labor that enacts it and the capital that frames it.
The dialogue between capital and labor is false because it is of the past. The

--

human individual. This relation between the human individual and the technical
individual is the most difficult to form. It presupposes a technical culture, which
introduces the capacity of different attitudes rather than that of work and of action
(work corresponding to the intelligence of the elements and action to the intelli­
gence of ensembles). What work and action have in common is the predominance
of finality over causality; in both cases, the effort is directed at a certain result to

CURRENT PROBLEMS


--


Within man, what can be in a relation with the individualized technical being is
the intuition of the schemas of functioning; as a being who participates in its regu­
lation, man can be coupled to the machine as an equal, and not merely as a being
who directs or utilizes it through the incorporation of ensembles, or as a being who
serves it by supplying matter and elements. By this we mean to say that neither an
economic theory nor an energetic theory can account for such a coupling of man
and machine. Economic or energetic links are too external for it to be possible
to define this true coupling through them. There is an inter-individual coupling

--

function only if the already-recorded magnetic tape was superior to a new tape in
recording certain sound figures, which is not the case. The plasticity in the memory
of machines is that of the medium, whereas in human memory it is the plasticity
of the content itself.15 One can say that, in man, the function of preserving rec­
ollections resides in memory, because memory, conceived as a set [ensemble] of
forms, of schemas, receives the recollection it records because memory connects
the recollection with its forms; in a machine, on the contrary, recording occurs
without prior memory. From this essential difference comes human memory’s sig­
nificant incapacity for fixing elements without order. It would take a very long

--

evokes a situation because it involves the same significations, the same feelings,
the same dangers as another, or simply because this similarity makes sense accord­
ing to the implicit vital coding constituted by experience. In both cases memory
allows self-regulation; but human memory enables a self-regulation according to
an ensemble of significations valid in the living and capable of developing only in
the latter; that of the machine grounds a self-regulation that makes sense in the
world of non-living beings. The significations according to which human memory
functions stop where those according to which machine memory functions begin.
The coupling of man to machine begins to exist from the very moment when a

--

automata lets us forget that these machines are precisely the ones that are most reli­
ant on man; while the other machines need man simply as a servant or organizer,
self-regulating machines need man as a technician, which is to say as an associate;
their relation to man is situated at the level of this regulation, not at the level of
elements or ensembles. But it is through this regulation that automatic machines
can be linked to the technical ensemble in which they function. Just as the human
individual is not linked to the group by his elementary functions, whether active
or perceptive, but by his self-regulation which gives him his personality and char­
acter, so the machine is integrated with the ensemble not only in an abstract and
preliminary way, by its function, but also, at every moment, by the way it performs
its own task according to the requirements of the ensemble. Th ere is no such thing

140

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

as a purely internal, entirely isolated self-regulation; the results of the action are
not merely results in themselves but also in relation to their external milieu, to the
ensemble. Now this aspect of self-regulation in which the whole o f the milieu must
be taken into account cannot be achieved by the machine alone, even if it is perfectly
automated. The type of memory and the type of perception needed for this aspect
of regulation call for the integration and transformation of the a posteriori into the
a p rio ri which only the living thing can achieve within itself. There is something
alive in a technical ensemble, and the integrative function of life can be ensured
only by human beings; the human being has the capacity to understand the func­
tioning of the machine, on the one hand, and the capacity to live, on the other: one
can speak o f technical life as being that which actualizes this relation between these
two functions in man. Man is capable o f taken upon himself the relation between

--

consists of the rhythm of the machines that surround him and that he connects
to one another. He fulfills the function of integration, and prolongs self-reg­
ulation beyond each monad of automatism through the interconnection and
inter-commutation of monads. The technician is indeed in a certain sense the
man of ensembles, but in a very different way from the one that characterizes
the industrialist. The industrialist, in the same way as the worker, is pushed by
finality: he targets a result; herein lies their alienation; the technician is the man
of the operation in the course of its accomplishment; he does not take charge of
directing the ensemble but rather guides its self-regulation during functioning. He
absorbs within himself the sense of the work and the sense of the industrial direc­
tion. He is the man who knows the internal schemas of functioning and organizes
them in relation to each other. On the contrary, machines are ignorant of general
solutions and cannot resolve general problems. Whenever it is possible to replace a

--

in the machine; this is the case for calculating machines that use a binary system
of numeration (rather than a decimal system) and reduce all operations to a series
of additions.17
In this sense one can affirm that the birth o f a technical philosophy at the level
of ensembles is possible only through an in-depth study of regulations, which is
to say of information. True technical ensembles are not the ones that use technical
individuals, but those that form a fabric of technical individuals through a rela­
tion of interconnection. Any philosophy of technics that starts from the reality
of ensembles using technical individuals without putting them into a relation of
information remains a philosophy of human power through technics, not a phi­
losophy of technics. One could use the term “autocratic philosophy of technics”
for a philosophy that takes the technical ensemble as a place where machines are
used in order to obtain power [puissance ]. The machine is only a means; the end
is the conquest of nature, the domestication o f natural forces by means of a first
act of enslavement: the machine is .a slave whose purpose is to make other slaves.
Such a dominating and enslaving inspiration can coincide with the quest for mans

--

entire world is still to reign, and every reign presupposes the acceptance of the
schemas of enslavement.
Technocratic philosophy itself is affected by an enslaving violence, insofar as it
is technocratic. A technicism that comes from a reflection on autocratic technical
ensembles is inspired by the unbridled will to conquer. It is immoderate, and lacks
internal control and self-mastery. It is a force that is unleashed and which can only
perpetuate itself for the duration of the ascending phase of success or conquest.
Saint-Simonism triumphed under the Second Empire because there were train
platforms to be built, railway track to be laid, bridges and viaducts to be spread

--

them to work or the legislative power to free themselves of all constraint. In France,
technocrats are essentially poly-technicians,18which is to say men who, with respect
to technics, find themselves in a situation of being intelligent users and organizers
of technics rather than veritable technicians. These mathematicians think in sets
[ensembles], not in individual operational units; what holds their attention is not so
much the machine as enterprise.
Furthermore, and essentially, in an even more profound way, the conditioning
arising from the state of technics comes to be added onto that of psychosocial
conditioning. The nineteenth century could produce only a technological techno­

--


information channel in the Watt governor, a channel o f counter-reaction {feed- back),
but this information is transmitted through a channel that is not distinct from the
one used by the motive power that allows the engine to move a resistant organ:
the regulator is connected to the output shaft; the whole ensemble made up of the
fly-wheels, the main shaft, the volumetric cylinder device and then the system for
transforming alternating movement into circular movement must therefore already
have slowed down through the loss of its kinetic energy so that the regulator can
intervene by increasing the admission time of the engine and consequently also

--

Information is thus halfway between pure chance and absolute regularity. One can
say that form, conceived as absolute spatial as well as temporal regularity, is not
information but a condition o f information; it is what receives information, the
a p rio ri that receives information. Form has a function of selectivity. But informa­
tion is not form, nor is it a collection \ensemble ] of forms; it is the variability of
forms, the influx of variation with respect to a form. It is the unpredictability of a
variation of form, not pure unpredictability o f all variation. We would thus be led
to distinguish three terms: pure chance, form, and information.
However, to this day, the new phase of the philosophy of technics, which fol­

--

tioning of a machine has no sense, and cannot give rise to true information signals
for another machine; a living being is required as mediator in order to interpret a
given functioning in terms o f information, and in order to convert it into the forms
for another machine. Man understands machines; for there to be a true technical
ensemble man has to play a functional role between machines rather than above
them. It is man who discovers significations: signification is the meaning [sens] that
an event takes on with respect to already existing forms; signification is what makes
an event have value as information.


--

when the machines comprise regulation; a machine that has regulation is in effect
a machine that harbors a certain margin of indeterminacy in its functioning; it can,
for instance, go fast or slow. Henceforth, its variations in speed become significant
and can take into account what is happening outside the machine, in the technical
ensemble. The more automatized the machines are, the more restricted its possible
variations in speed are; they can thus go unperceived; but what is happening here
is in fact what is happening for a very stable oscillator that is synchronized by
another even more stable oscillator: the oscillator can continue to receive infor­
mation as long as it is not rigorously stable, and despite the fact that the margin

--


another relaxation oscillator. If one couples two relaxation oscillators to each other,
these two oscillators synchronize in such a way that one cannot say which one
synchronizes and which one is synchronized; in fact, they synchronize each other,
and the ensemble functions as a single oscillator, with a single period that is slightly
different from the periods proper to each one of the oscillators.
It can appear too simple to oppose open machines and closed machines, in the
sense Bergson gives these two adjectives.21 And yet this difference is real; the exis­
tence o f a regulation in a machine leaves the machine open insofar as it localizes the

--

it is virtual, cannot play a role for the machine. It can only react to something that
is positively given, actually done. The living thing has the faculty to modify itself
according to the virtual: this faculty is the sense o f time, which the machine does
not have because it does not live.
Technical ensembles are characterized by the fact that in them a relation between
technical objects takes shape at the level of the margin of indeterminacy of each
technical objects way of functioning. This relation between technical objects is of
a problematic type, insofar as it puts indeterminacies into correlation, and for this
reason it cannot be taken on by the objects themselves; it cannot be calculated, nor

because he alone has the power to think; man is the witness to the machines and
represents them in relation to one another; machines can neither think nor experi­
ence [vivre] their mutual relation; they can only act upon one another in actuality,
according to causal schemas. Man as witness to machines is responsible for their
relation; the individual machine represents man, but man represents the ensemble
of machines, for there is not one machine of all machines, whereas there can be a
thought that encompasses all machines.
One can call a technological attitude that which compels man to look after not
only the utilization o f a technical being, but after the correlation of technical beings

--

functioning to be an iterative stereotypy. The opposition between technics and cul­
ture will last until culture discovers that each machine is not an absolute unit, but
only an individualized technical reality that is open according to two paths: that
of the relation to elements, and that of the inter-individual relations within the
technical ensemble. The role culture has assigned to man alongside the machine
is at odds with technical reality; it assumes that the machine is substantialized,
materialized, and consequently devalued; the machine is in fact less consistent and

158

--

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

less substantial than culture assumes; it does not relate to man as a single block, but
through the free plurality of its elements, or the open series of its possible relations
with other machines within the technical ensemble. Culture is unjust toward the
machine, not only in its judgments or its preconceptions, but at the very level of
knowledge: the cognitive intention of culture toward the machine is substantializ­
ing; the machine is closed up in this reductive vision that considers it to be perfect
and finished in itself, that makes it coincide with its actual state, with its material

The advent of the conditions allowing man to see the technical relation functioning
in an objective way is the prime condition for the incorporation o f the knowledge
of technical reality and of the values implied by its existence into culture. Now,
these conditions are realized in the technical ensembles employing machines that
have a sufficient degree of indeterminacy. For man, the action of having to inter­
vene as a mediator in this relation between machines grants him a situation of
independence in which he can acquire a cultural vision of technical realities. The
engagement in the asymmetrical relation with a single machine cannot provide the

through the advent of structure. This structuration is the advent of an organization
that is the basis of an equilibrium of metastability. Such genesis opposes itself to the
degradation of the potential energies contained in a system through the passage to a
stable state from which transformation is no longer possible.
The general hypothesis we are making about the sense of the coming-into-being of mans relation with the world consists in considering the whole [>l’ensemble]
formed by man and the world as a system. This hypothesis, however, is not lim­
ited to the affirmation that man and the world form a vital system, comprising
the living thing and its milieu; evolution could indeed be considered an adapta­
tion, i.e., a quest for a stable equilibrium of the system through a reduction of the

--

mans relation with the world, the other simultaneous and correlated aspect being
the institution of definite religions. However, coming-into-being does not stop at
the discovery o f technicity: from being a solution, technicity once more becomes a
problem when it reconstitutes a system via an evolution that leads from technical
objects to technical ensembles: the technical universe is saturated then over-satu­
rated in turn, at the same time as the religious universe, just as had happened with
the magical universe. The inherence o f technicity to technical objects is provisional;
it constitutes only a moment of genetic coming-into-being.
Now, according to this hypothesis, technicity must never be considered an iso­

--

to make them converge and establish a mediation between them. Now, in order
for this mediation to be possible, the very genesis of these forms of thought must
be known and accomplished in a complete manner on the basis of previous stages
of technicity and religiosity; therefore, philosophical thought must start from the
genesis of technicity, integrated into the ensemble of genetic processes that precede
it, follow and surround it, not only in order to be able to know technicity in itself,
but in order to grasp the problems that dominate the philosophical problematic at
their very basis: the theory of knowledge and the theory of action, in their relation
with the theory of being.

ground, since the modes of thought are at different levels (for example a science
and a technics) and exist at the same time, and they neither constitute a single
genetic lineage nor arise from the same sudden outpouring o f the primitive magical
universe. True and balanced relations only exist between phases of the same level
(for example between a technical ensemble and a religion) or between successive
degrees of genesis that are part of the same lineage (for example between the stage
of technics and religions in the seventeenth century and the contemporary stages of
science and ethics). True relations only exist in a genetic ensemble balanced around
a neutral point, envisioned in its totality.
This is precisely the goal to be attained: the mission of reflexive thought is to lift
upright and perfect the successive waves of genesis through which the primitive
unity of man’s relation with the world splits in two and comes to sustain both

figure-ground structure is prior to any segregation of units; the mutual relation of
correspondence of such a key-point and of such a ground neither presupposes this
key-point to be isolated from the network of other key-points nor this ground to
be without continuity with the other grounds: a universe is what is structured in
this way, and not a set [ensemble] of individuals; after the rupture of the primitive
reticulation the first detached beings to appear are technical objects and religious

to it. Technical thought conceives of an overall functioning [fonctionnement d ’e n­
semble] as a series of elementary processes, acting point by point and step by step;
it localizes and multiplies the mediation schemas, always remaining below unity.
The element, in technical thought, is more stable, better known, and in a certain
way more perfect than the ensemble; it is really an object, whereas the ensemble
always remains to a certain extent inherent in the world. Religious thought finds
the opposite balance: for religious thought, totality is that which is more stable,
stronger, and more valid than the element.
Technics bring, as much in the theoretical domain as in the ethical domain,

--

it in the form of results; it mediates and objectivizes the results of the action by
comparison with those o f the technical operation, performing a decomposition
of the action into partial results, into elementary accomplishments. In the same
way that in the sciences, technicity introduces the search for a how through the
decomposition o f an overall phenomenon {phénomène d ’ensemble] into elementary
operations, so too in ethics, technicity introduces the search for a decomposition
of a global action into elements of action; the total action being envisaged as that
which leads to a result, the decomposition of the action called for by technics con­
siders the elements of an action as movements obtaining partial results. Technicity
presupposes that an action is limited to its results; it is not concerned with the
subject of the action taken in its real totality, nor even with an action in its totality,
insofar as the totality o f the action is founded on the unity of the subject. The con­
cern with the result in ethics is the analog of the search for a how in the sciences;
result and process remain below the unity of action or of the whole [ensemble] of
the real.
The postulation of an absolute and unconditional justification that religion
directs at ethics translates into the search for intention, as opposed to the search for
the result that is inspired by technics. In the sciences, religious thought introduces

--

ing, just as language sustains the ability to think, without nevertheless itself being
identical to thought.
Aesthetic feeling is not relative to an artificial work; it signals, in the exercise
of a mode of thinking that is subsequent to the split, a perfection of completion
that makes the ensemble of acts of thought capable of surpassing the limits of its
domain so as to evoke the completion of thought in other domains: a technical
work perfect enough to be equivalent to a religious act, a religious work perfect
enough to have the organizational and operational force of a technical activity give
off a feeling of perfection. Imperfect thought stays within its domain; the perfec­

The radar antenna is beautiful when it is seen from the point o f view of a ship,
sitting atop the highest super-structure; placed on the ground, it is nothing more
than a rather crude cone, mounted on a pivot; it was beautiful as the structural
and functional completion of this whole [ensemble] that is the ship, but it is not
beautiful in itself and without reference to a universe.
This is why the discovery of the beauty of technical objects cannot be left to per­
ception alone: the function of the object needs to be understood and thought; in
other words, a technical education is needed if the beauty of technical objects is to

appear to the one who only sees a tower of mediocre height, with a parabolic grid
in which a very small dipole is placed? All of these figurai structures need to be
understood as emitting and receiving the bundle of directed waves that propagates
from one tower to another, through the clouds and the fog; it is with respect to
this invisible, imperceptible, and real, actual transmission that the whole [ensemble]
formed by the mountains and the towers is beautiful, for the towers are placed at
the key-points of the two mountains in order to constitute the wireless cable; this
type of beauty is as abstract as that of a geometric construction, and the function of
the object needs to be understood in order for its structure, and the relation of this

The technical object can be beautiful in a different way, through its integration
into the human world that it extends; thus a tool can be beautiful in action when it
properly adapts itself so well to a body that it somehow seems to be a natural exten­
sion of it and whose structural characteristics it appears to amplify; a dagger is only
beautiful in the hand that holds it; a tool, a machine or a technical ensemble, are
equally beautiful when they become integrated within the human world and cover
it over in expressing it; if the alignment of boards in a telephone center is beauti­
ful, then it is not beautiful in itself or in its relation with the geographical world,
since it can be anywhere; it is beautiful because these luminous flashes that trace

universalized nor subjectivized; the artist is not confused with the work, and, where
a certain idolatry arises, it is recognized as idolatry; it is the work of art’s technicity
that prevents aesthetic reality from being confused with the universal function
of totality; the work of art remains artificial and localized, produced at a certain
moment; it is not anterior and superior to the world and to man. The set [ensemble]
of all works of art perpetuates the magical universe and maintains its structure: it
marks the neutral point between technics and religion.
The aesthetic universe, however, is far from being a residue, a simple remnant of
a previous epoch; it represents the meaning o f coming-into-being diverging in the

as well as through Kurt Koffka’s citation, which Simondon cites in his study on psychology as his source for the term which
he translates as “caractère d ’appel," and which he interprets in the direction o f a sort of phenomenological realism: “Neither
need, nor experience are sufficient to explain appeal aspects: there exists a ‘silent’ (implicit) organization o f the object that
belongs to it just like its color or its shape, and which makes the appeal character inherent in it [...] In this way, Koffka
and Kurt Lewin abandon isomorphism: the system with a form is the whole [l ’ensemble] constituted by the subject and his
behavioral field, along with the entire network o f forces connecting the sub-ensembles o f the subject; there is no longer a
physical field having its form, followed by a physiological field with own its form, and then finally psychological field having
a third form, with these three independent forms being isomorphic among one another.” The forces at play in appeal aspects
cannot be identified with those o f classical mechanics,” which “can be reductively explained in abstract vectorial terms;
on the contrary, the tensions between Ego and objects have a nature and a specificity that are conserved in the effect; [...]

--

Aesthetic intention thus doesn’t create, or at least should not create a specialized
domain, which is that of art; but art, o f course, develops into a domain and has an
implicit internal finality: to preserve the transductive unity of a domain of reality
that tends to separate itself by way of specialization. Art is a deep reaction against
the loss of meaning and of the attachment to the whole [ensemble ] of being in its
destiny; it is not or must not be compensation, a reality occurring after the fact, but
on the contrary a primitive unity, a preface to a development according to unity;
art announces, prefigures, introduces, or completes, but it does not make real: it is
the deep and unitary inspiration that begins and consecrates.
One could even ask oneself whether art, to the extent that it observes, is not also
what somehow sums up [résume] and renders an ensemble of realities transposable
to another temporal unit, to another moment in history. Art, in the celebration
and final investiture that it brings about, transforms the fulfilled and localized real­
ity hic et nunc into a reality that will be able to traverse time and space: it renders

power, absolute power.
Together with virtuality, the failure of technical action leads to the discovery of
what subjectively corresponds to this virtuality, which is the possible as optative;
the ensemble of schemas is an incomplete reality; the schemas of action are the
beginnings of action, an incitement applied to the world so that an operation
is carried out [se réalisé\\ this action is wanted, posited as desirable and already
effectively desired insofar as man tends to carry it out; but it does not possess all
its autonomy within itself, since human wish only has the status of a kernel of

--

theoretical thought seeks to render the qualities and forces of the world compatible
in a superior representation, grounding the Gscopia [theöria].
The theoretical knowledge that expresses religiosity seeks a systematic monistic
representation of the universe and o f man starting from the whole [le tout] in
order to go toward the part, and from the whole [l’ensemble] of time in order to
apprehend the instant in its particularity: it is monist and deductive, an essentially
contemplative knowledge, whereas the theoretical knowledge coming from tech­
nics is operational; this knowledge is contemplative in the sense that the subject is
in a situation o f inferiority and posteriority with respect to the reality that is to be

--

itself like a reflection.
Indeed the use of number within the sciences appears to be of religious origin
rather than o f technical origin; indeed, number is basically structure that allows
deduction and allows the grasping of a particular reality in its reference to the
whole [ l’ensemble], so as to integrate itself within it; it is the number of the phi­
losophers, as defined by Plato who opposes the philosophical metretics to that of
the merchants, a pure practical procedure that does not facilitate knowledge of the
existence of the relations between beings, and between beings and the whole [le
tout], conceived as cosmos. The ideal numbers are the structures that enable the

--

on the basis o f this new weight; they refract human reality into different direc­
tions [en des sens différents] : this commonality of object can serve as a basis for the
edification o f a culture via the intermediary of philosophical reflection; there is a
technics of man and every technics is to a certain extent a technics of man within
a group, because man intervenes in the determination of the technical ensemble;
the saturation of technical activity can lead to a structuration other than that of
the fragmentation [éclatement] of thought into a theoretical mode and a practical
mode; philosophical thought can allow for technical thought to remain more fully
technical for a longer period o f time, so as to attempt to relate the two opposing

through their rapid development. It is thus not only between mans technics and
social and political thought that the relation must be established, but between all
the elementary functions and all the functions of the whole [les fonctions d ’ensemble\, including the technics of man and the technics of the world, religious thought
and social and political thought. Philosophical thought is appropriate for such an
elaboration, because it can know the coming-into-being o f the different forms of
thought and establish a relation between the successive stages of genesis, in par­
ticular between the stage that carries out [,accomplit] the break within the magical

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

their key-points: tools are free and abstract, always transportable everywhere one
goes, but technical ensembles are true networks concretely attached to the natural
world; a dam cannot be built just anywhere, nor can a solar furnace. Some notions
o f traditional culture appear to suppose that the development of technics causes
the disappearance of the particular aspect of each place and region, leading to the
loss of customs and local artisanal inflections; in reality, technical development
creates a far more important and much more firmly rooted concretization than
the one it destroys; an artisanal custom, like a regional costume, can, by simple
influence, be transported from one place to another; it is only rooted in the human
world; conversely, a technical ensemble is profoundly rooted in the natural milieu.
There are no coal mines in primary terrains.
So it is that some high points of the natural, technical, and human world are
constituted; it is the ensemble, the interconnection of these high points that makes
this polytechnic — both natural and human — universe; the structures of this
reticulation become social and political. In existence, technics are separate neither
for the natural world nor for the human world. And yet, for technical thought,
they remain as if they were separate due to the fact that no thought has been
sufficiently developed in order to allow for the theorization of this reticulation of
concrete technical ensembles. This theorization is the task that befalls philosophical
thought, for there is a new reality here that is not yet represented in culture. Beyond
the technical determinations and norms, one would have to discover polytechnic
and technological determinations and norms. A world of the plurality of technics
exists that has its own structures, and which ought to find representations within

--

that functionally attach them to the human world and to the natural world, as a
concrete mediation between these two worlds.
The introduction of adequate representations of technical objects into culture
would result in the key-points of technical networks becoming real terms of ref­
erence for the ensemble of human groups, whereas they currently are only key
terms for those who understand them, which is to say for the technicians of each
specialty; for other men, they only have a practical value, and correspond to very
confused concepts; technical ensembles introduce themselves into the world as if
they had no natural or human right of belonging, while a mountain or promon­
tory, which have less concrete regulatory power than some technical ensembles, are
known by all men of a region and belong to the representation of the world.

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

229

And yet, one can wonder to what extent the creation of a general technology
brings technics closer to religion; the recognition o f the genuine [véritable ] com­
plex operational schemas and of the integration o f technical ensembles would not
be enough to enable this rapprochement if there weren’t, along with a theoreti­
cal awareness of processes also a normative value contained in them. Indeed, the
reticular structures of integrated technics are no longer mere means available for
an action and abstractly transportable anywhere, utilizable at any moment; one
changes tools and instruments, one can construct or repair a tool oneself, but one
cannot change the network, one doesn’t construct a network of one’s own: one can
only connect to a network, adapt to it, participate in it; the network dominates
and frames [enserre] the action of the individual, it even dominates each technical
ensemble. Whence a form of participation in the natural world and in the human
world that gives an incorruptible collective normativity to technical activity; it is no
longer only a slightly abstract solidarity of trades as evoked by Sully Prudhomme
(the solidarity of specialists, the bricklayer, the baker), but an extremely concrete
and actual solidarity, existing instant by instant throughout the interplay of mul­
tiple conditionings; through the technical networks, the human world acquires a
high degree of internal resonance. The powers, forces, and potentials that drive
toward action exist in the reticular technical world in the same way in which they
might have existed in the primitive magical universe: technicity is a part of the
world, it is not only an ensemble of means, but an ensemble of conditionings of
action and of incitements to act; the tool or instrument doesn’t have normative
power because it is permanently available to the individual; technical networks take
on more normative power as the internal resonance of human activity throughout
technical realities becomes greater.
However, the valorization of technical ensembles and their normative value
entail a very particular form of respect, which has in view pure technicity in itself.
It is this form of respect, founded on the knowledge of technical reality, and not
on the prestige of the imagination, which can penetrate culture. A large highway,
at the edge of a big city, imposes this form of respect; moreover, a harbor, the rail

state of technicity, what we mean to say is that the distribution and integration of
key-points of social and political thought in the world at least partially coincides
with the distribution and integration of the technical key-points, and that this
coinciding becomes all the more perfect as technics becomes increasingly inte­
grated within the universe, in the form of fixed ensembles, attached to one another,
constraining [enserrant] human individuals into the links they determine.

export, in other words with economic realities that are the result of the existence
of technics, but which translate the manner in which technics are used by human
groups; these modes of utilization of technics by human groups are themselves
subject to technics that no longer apply to the natural world, but rather to the
human world, and that don’t produce technical objects or technical ensembles,
unless one can consider the means of advertising or the retail organizations as such.
Currently, it could therefore be said that the agreement between technical thought
and non-technical thought is only possible at the price of very great simplification
and abstraction, as much in the technical domain as in the non-technical domain.

propaganda, just as a definite technics of human management leads to a social
and political option. But this encounter, this mutual complicity, can only exist at
the price of abandoning fidelity to the elementary functions, characterizing true
technicity, and the correlative abandonment o f the mission to represent the func­
tions of totality characteristic of religious thought. The alliance o f an ensemble of
procedures and of a mythology is not the encounter of technicity and of respect
with regard to totality.
This is why philosophical thought must maintain the continuity that exists
between the successive stages of technical thought and religious thought, all the

And yet, if the technics of man fail in their function of the analysis of elements,
and act generally through empirical procedures (which is what statistical concep­

they accept detaching themselves from the real object, the element, individual,
or ensemble. There can be no true technics separate from the human world; the

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

technics o f the human world must have an objective material, they cannot be
purely psychological, lest they become procedures, in other words, it is by way of
an enlargement o f technical ensembles comprising an integration into both the
natural world and the human world that one can subsequently act upon the human
world, that is, through, and according to, this natural and human ensemble: as
mediation between the natural world and the human world, technical thought can
act upon the human world only via the intermediary of this mediation. Human
reality can be the object of technics only when it is already engaged within a tech­
nical relation. There is no legitimate technics other than that of technical reality;

--

human reality can be modified, namely culture: the active intermediary between
successive generations, the concurrent [simultanés] human groups and successive
or concurrent individuals) that must be incorporated into technics as a workable
material; it is culture, considered as a lived totality, that must incorporate the tech­
nical ensembles by knowing their nature, in order to be able to regulate human life
according to these technical ensembles. Culture must remain above all technics,
but it must incorporate into its content the knowledge and intuition of genuine
technical schemas. Culture is that through which man regulates his relation with
the world and with himself; and yet if culture were not to incorporate technology,
it would contain an opaque zone and wouldn’t be able to contribute its regulative
normativity to the coupling of man and the world. For in this coupling of man
and the world, which is that of technical ensembles, there are schemas of activity
and conditioning that can be clearly thought only by virtue of concepts defined by
a reflexive but direct study. Culture must be contemporary with technics. Culture
must reshape itself [se reformer] and must once again take up its content stage by
stage. If culture is only traditional, then it is false, because it implicitly and spon­

founded on the normative notion of utility that is at once valorizing and devaluing.
But this notion of utensil and of utility is inadequate to the effective and actual
role of technical ensembles within the human world; it thus cannot be regulative
in an effective way.
Deprived of the contribution of cultural regulation, which passes through the
intermediary of an adequate representation o f technical realities, this coupling of
man and the world develops in isolation, in a non-integrated, anomical manner.

--

Nothing effectively proves that technical reality can be adequately known through
concepts; conceptual knowledge can indeed designate and cover technical real­
ity at the level of separate technical objects, which can be classified according to
structures and usages. But only with great difficulty can it lead into knowledge of
technical ensembles. To acquire this knowledge, the human being must really be
put into a situation, since it is a mode of existence that he must experience. The
tool, instrument, or isolated machine can be perceived by a subject who remains
detached from them. But the technical ensemble cannot be grasped by intuition,
for it cannot be considered a detached, abstract, or m anipulate object at man’s
disposal. It corresponds to an experience o f existence [épreuve] and a situation, it is
tied by reciprocal action with the subject.
In the same way one used to consider journeys as a means for acquiring culture,
because they constituted a mode of placing man into a situation, one should also
consider the technical experiences of being placed into a situation with respect
to an ensemble, with effective responsibility, as having cultural value. To put it
another way, every human being should to a certain extent take part in technical
ensembles, that is, take on a responsibility, a definite task with respect to such an
ensemble and be connected with a network of universal technics. Furthermore,
individual man should not simply experience a single kind of technical ensemble,
but rather a plurality of them, just as a traveler will have to encounter several peo­
ples, and experience their mores.
However, this kind of experience must be conceived more as a way of experi­
encing the situating of each type of technics and ensemble of technics, than as an
effort to participate in the condition of man in each of the technics: for in each

236


--

in the different technics. It is the particular situating in the technical network that
must be experienced, insofar as it places man in the presence of and within a series
o f actions and processes that he does not direct alone, but in which he participates.
The philosopher, comparable in this role to the artist, can help in raising aware­
ness o f the situation within the technical ensemble, by reflecting it within himself
and by expressing it; but, again just as the artist, all he can do is be the one who
solicits an intuition in others, once a definite sensitivity has been awakened and
allows the grasping of the sense o f a real experience.
However, we must note that art, as a means of expression and as awakening of
the cultural awareness of technical ensembles, is limited; art goes through aïo0r|Gtç
[afsthësis] and is therefore naturally inclined to grasp the object, tool, instrument,
or machine; but true technicity, that which can be integrated into culture, is not
in the manifest. All the prestigious color photographs of sparks, of fumes, all the
recordings of noise, sounds, or images, generally remain a use [exploitation] of tech­
nical reality and not a revelation of this reality. Technical reality must be thought,
and even be known through participation in its schemas of action; aesthetic feeling
can emerge, but only after this intervention of real intuition and participation and
not as a fruit of a mere spectacle: every technical spectacle remains puerile and
incomplete if it is not preceded by the integration into the technical ensemble.
The intuitions of technical participation, however, are not opposed to the forces
and qualities of religious and social and political thought. Social and political
thought is continuous with respect to religious thought when it is not an actual
and already realized totality properly speaking (for totality is what it is, it is an
absolute and cannot push toward action), but instead is the latency of broader
ensembles undergirding actual structures, and the validity of this announcement
of new structures; social and political thought expresses the relation of totality with
respect to the part, of virtual totality with respect to the actual part. It expresses
the function of relative totality, whereas religions express the function of absolute
totality, and it expresses the function of virtual totality, whereas religions express
the function of actual totality. And yet, there can be a complementary relation
between the intuitions of integration into technical ensembles and social and polit­
ical intuitions, because technical intuitions express the result of history and of the
conditioning of life, of the hic et nunc , whereas the social and political intuitions
are a project going toward the future, the active expression of potentials. Social
and political thoughts are the expression of tendencies and forces that exceed all

237

actual given structure; the intuitions relating to technical ensembles express what
humanity has done, what is done, and what is structured because done, accom­
plished. Figurai power can thus remain invested in technics and ground power in
social and political thought, insofar as figurai reality is what is given in the system
of actuality whereas ground power contains potentials and keeps the becoming in
reserve. While impossible at the level of the relation between elementary technical
objectivity and universal religious thought, the relation once more becomes possi­
ble when it establishes itself between technical ensembles, which is the expression
of actuality, and social and political thought, which is the expression of virtuality.
There is a compatibility between actuality and virtuality through the real coming-into-being, whose meaning [sens] is stretched taught between this actuality and
this virtuality. Philosophical thought grasps the correlation between actuality and
virtuality, and it maintains it by establishing the coherence o f this relation.
It is thus the sense [sens] of coming-into-being, the ability of technics to engen­
der the coming-into-being of both the natural and the human world, that makes
elementary intuition and the intuition of the ensemble compatible; technical
intuition, at the level of ensembles, expresses coming-into-being as both basis and
result obtained; social and political intuition is the integration of tendencies, the
expression of virtualités and forces o f coming-into-being, in the same reality. At
the level of technical thought attached to tools, and of universalizing religious
thought, there cannot be any direct encounter between the two types of thought,
because the mediation of coming-into-being is not possible; each tool, each sep­
arate technics that is capable o f manipulating tools present themselves as stable
and definitive. Universalizing religious thought also presents itself as stable and
definitive, with reference to an atemporal ground. Conversely, the introduction of
technicity to ensembles which situate man as organizer or as element makes tech­
nics evolve; to the same extent and at the same time, the evolving aspect of human
groups becomes conscious and this consciousness creates socio-political thought.
Both born from coming-into-being, one expressing the definite past serving as its
basis and the other the possible future serving as its goal, the technical thought of
ensembles and social and political thought are coupled through their conditions of
origin and their points of integration into the world.
Thus it is within the perspective of permanent change within technical and
socio-political structures that technical thought and socio-political thought can
coincide. Elementary technicity, the one that animates the thought o f artisans, and

technical ensembles and for thinking the coming-into-being of totalities; without
the norm of elementary technics and that of universal religiosity, the technical
thought o f ensembles in a process of coming-into-being and the social and political
thought of evolving communities would lose their reciprocal tension; the thought
of technical ensembles needs to be inspired by that of elements, and that of the
coming-into-being of the human world by the function of totality, in order for
these two forms of thought, which must meet analogically but which must not be
confused with each other, to preserve their autonomy and not enslave one another.
Because the functional totality of thought coming from the primitive relation with
the world must be maintained by the real bipolarity of the primitive phase shift’s
results; culture is directed by this bipolarity; it develops between technical thought
and religious thought; it is culture that links the lived understanding [<compréhen­
sion] of the technicity of ensembles with that o f the human groups represented in
socio-political thought.
The past — i.e., the first forms of technical thought and of religious thought, at
the level of the first splitting in two o f magical thought, as well as aesthetic activity
placed at the neutral point o f this first split — must be preserved as cultural con­
tent, i.e., as a foundation for providing the norms for current thought, but it is only
as cultural content that they must be preserved; it would be a transgression \faute]
against coming-into-being to want to substitute the representation of elements,
tools or instruments for that of the current technicity of ensembles; for technicity,
in its current lived reality, no longer simply resides at the level of elements, but
also and essentially at the level of ensembles; today ensembles are depositaries of
technicity in the same way that the fragmentation into elements had been prior to
this; thought must start from the knowledge of the technicity of elements, re-situated in the past, in order to grasp the technicity of ensembles in their reality, for
it effectively results from it: thought must go from the cultural to the actual in
order to understand the actual in its reality. Furthermore, religious thought is a
permanent reminder of the sense o f totality, and culture must renew the rootedness
of socio-political thought in universalized religious thought, proceeding from the

nical objects, on the basis of a general normalization o f the common vocabulary
and notions, replacing the false specificity of trade terms, caused by use and not
by the essence proper to the elements; technology is that on the basis of which
the plurality of technical objects, which is the depositary of primitive technics,
serves as the basis for the constitution o f technical ensembles. Ecumenism is that
on the basis of which the universalizing unicity of religious thought, which is the
depositary of the function of primitive totality, serves as a basis for socio-political
thought. Technology accomplishes, on the basis of plurality, a conversion toward
unity, whereas ecumenism, first of all grasping unity, accomplishes or allows for the

implicit axiomatic is constituted by the relation that exists between the reality to
be known and the knowing subject, i.e., by the primary status of the reality to be
known. Technical thought indeed provides the model for the intelligibility of the
elements taken one by one, in their combination, and of their mutual relations
that are constitutive of the ensemble; the real to be known resides at the end of the
effort for knowledge, it is not a mass given all at once in its totality; made of ele­
ments because it is knowable as a combination of elements, this reality is essentially
an object. Conversely, being the paradigm of deductive thought, religious thought
starts from a function o f the whole instantly recognized as having unconditional

that are already conditioned by it before coming into existence and being fulfilled
[accomplis]. For contemplative knowledge, the real is absolute subject, whereas for
operational knowledge it is still object, in the first sense of “that which is placed in
front,” as a piece of wood is placed on a workbench, waiting for its incorporation
into the ensemble through the process of construction. For operational knowledge,
the real does not precede the operation of knowledge; it comes after it. Even if it
appears to precede it according to common experience, it succeeds it according to
real knowledge, since this knowledge only grasps the real when it has reconstructed
it through the manipulation of elements.

since it has an internal unity that grants its autonomy and its singularity, prevent­
ing a genesis through accumulation; lastly, knowledge by way of intuition is really
mediate in the sense that it does not grasp being in its absolute totality, like the
idea, or on the basis o f elements and by combination, like the concept, but rather
grasps being at the level o f domains constituting a structured ensemble. Intuition
is neither sensible nor intellectual; it is the analogy between the coming-into-being
of known being and the coming-into-being of the subject, the coincidence of two
comings-into-being: intuition is not merely the grasping of figurai realities, like the
concept, nor a reference to the totality of the ground of the real taken in its unity,

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

Intuition intervenes as mediator, considering ensembles in which there is genesis of
structure, i.e., genesis of a correlation between figure and ground. Intuition is thus
a particular procedure of philosophical knowledge, because by virtue of it thought
can grasp being in its essence, which is the formula o f its genetic coming-intobeing, and remain at the neutral point o f this coming-into-being in order to ensure
the function of convergence.

power of structuration, as a capacity for the invention of the structures that resolve
problems o f coming-into-being, at the level of this intermediary nature between
the plurality and totality that is the reticular diversity of the domains of existence.
Intuition recovers the figurai aspect and the ground aspect by in a real unity;
for the elements and totality are not the concrete whole [ensemble] of being; the
unity o f being is the active center on the basis of which exist, through a split, figure
and ground, i.e., the elements on the one hand and totality on the other; intuition
knows and fulfills this unity of being, which is the combination of elements and
totality; intuition is the relation o f figure and ground in itself; it is not, like the
idea, co-natural with the being it grasps, for this co-naturalness can grasp only
the ground, which is not the whole [ensemble] of being, it is not abstract like the
concept, which abandons the concreteness o f being in order to preserve only the
definite figure. Grasping the primitive relation of figure and ground, intuition is
analogical with respect to being; it is a knowledge that justifies neither full realism
nor pure nominalism, but a stable mixture of these two ways of envisioning knowl­

power, its functions of elaboration and invention, at the service of the technical
task; the real unity is that of the task rather than that of the tool, but the task
cannot be objectivated and can only be lived, experienced, accomplished, and not
strictly speaking, reflected upon [réfléchie]. At the second level, technical objects
are part of technical ensembles. Consequently, at the first level or at the second
level, technical objects cannot be considered as absolute realities and as existing by
themselves, even after having been constructed. Their technicity can be understood
only through the integration of the activity of a human user or the functioning of a
technical ensemble. It would thus not be legitimate to seek to understand the tech­
nicity of an object on the basis of an induction comparable to that which one can
apply to natural beings; the technical object, which never harbors all of technicity
on its own, either because it is a tool or because it is the element in an ensemble,
must be known by philosophical thought, i.e., by a thought that has the intuition
of the coming-into-being of the modes of relation between man and the world.
The use of this genetic method defines the technical object through reference
to the technicity of the artisanal operation or the technical ensemble, and not the
technicity of the operation or that of the ensemble on the basis of some property
of the object that technicity would be. This functional aspect, however, and this
conditioning of the technical objects genesis are indeed effectively translated by
a particular type of the technical objects coming-into-being, what we have called
the concretization of the technical object. The process of this concretization can

object of a technicity that is not entirely contained in it, can be understood only
by philosophical thought following the genesis of the technical and non-technical
modes o f the relation between o f man and the world. Whence the use in this study
of a genetic method applied first to technical objects and then to the study of the
situation and role o f technical thought in the whole [l'ensemble] of thought.9

operation; there is no longer heterogeneity between the preparation of the tech­
nical operation and the functioning of this operation; this operation prolongs the
technical functioning just as the functioning anticipates this operation: the func­
tioning is an operation and the operation a functioning. One cannot speak of the
work of a machine, but only of its functioning, which is an ordered ensemble of
operations. Form and matter, if they still exist, are at the same level and belong to
the same system; there is continuity between the technical and the natural.

it is a mental operation, a mental functioning that is of the same order as scientific
knowledge. There is an equality of levels between science and technical invention;
the mental schema is what enables invention and science; it is the mental schema,
once more, that allows the use o f the technical object as productive, in an industrial
ensemble, or as scientific, in an experimental setup. Technical thought is present in
all technical activity, and technical thought is of the order of invention; it can be
communicated; it authorizes participation.

runs the risk of not being very effective unless it goes as far as the very foundation
of the communication between man and machine. In order for information to
be exchanged, man must possess within himself a technical culture, which is to
say an ensemble of forms that, upon encountering the forms contributed by the
machine, will be able to elicit meaning [signification]. The machine remains one
of the obscure zones of our civilization, at all social levels. This alienation exists as
much at the management level [dans la maîtrise] as it does at the level of workers.
The true center of industrial life, that in relation to which everything must order

of the norms and of law in the industrial domain is neither labor nor property,
but technicity. Inter-human communication must establish itself at the level of
technics through technical activity, not via the values of work or economic criteria;
social conditions and economic factors cannot be harmonized because they are
parts of different ensembles; they can only find mediation within a predominantly
technical organization. This level of technical organization where man encounters
man not as the member of a class but as a being who expresses himself within the
technical object which is homogeneous with respect to his activity, is the level of
the collective, going beyond the inter-individual and the given social.

councils; in order to be efficient and creative, an employee committee should be
essentially technical. The organization of channels of information in a company
must follow the lines of technical operation and not that of social hierarchy or of
purely inter-individual relations, which are inessential with respect to technical
operation. The company, being the ensemble of technical objects and men, must
be organized on the basis o f its essential function, that is its technical function­
ing; it is at the level o f the technical operation that the whole [ensemble] of the
organization can be thought, not as a confrontation of classes, i.e., as a pure social
ensemble, or as a grouping of individuals each having their psyche, which brings
the ensemble down to an inter-psychological schema, but as a unit [une unité\ of
technical functioning. The technical world is a world of the collective, which is
adequately thought neither on the basis of the brute social [fact], nor on the basis
of the psyche. To consider technical activity as inessential in its very structure,
and to take as essential either the social communities or the inter-human relations

modify the state of the conducting triode, which leads to the switching of the setup:
the previously conductive triode becomes non-conductive, and the non-conduc­
tive triode becomes conductive. This circuit is often used in calculating machines,
because it delivers only one o f the two pulses it receives, this pulse in turn is capable
of activating another ensemble of triodes; it therefore realizes through its physical
functioning the analog of the mental operation of addition. To establish a chain
of Eccles-Jordan circuits, a counting scale using a numeric system on the basis
