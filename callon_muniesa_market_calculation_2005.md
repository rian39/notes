Calculating does not necessarily mean performing mathematical or even numerical operations (Lave 1988). Calculation starts by establishing distinctions between things or states of the world, and by imagining and estimating courses of action associated with those things or with those states as well as their consequences. By starting with this type of definition (wide, but usual) of the notion of calculation, we try to avoid the distinction (also conventional, but too sharp) between judgement and calculation. 1231


First, in order to be calculated, the entities taken into account have to be detached. A finite number of entities are moved, arranged and ordered in a single space 1231

>A new entity must be produced (a sum, an ordered list, an evaluation, a binary choice, etc.) that corresponds precisely to the manipulations effected in the calculative space and, consequently, links (summarizes) the entities taken into account. ... it has to be able to leave the calculative space and circulate elsewhere in an acceptable way (without taking with it the whole calculative apparatus). 1231 

>Isolating objects from their context, grouping them in the same frame, establishing original relations between them, classifying them and summing them up are all costly activities that raise the question of calculative power. 1232

> A calculative agency will be all the more powerful when it is able to: a) establish a long, yet finite list of diverse entities; b) allow rich and varied relations between the entities thus selected, so that the space of possible classifications and reclassifications is largely open; c) formalize procedures and algorithms likely to multiply the possible hierarchies and classifications between these entities. As this calculative power depends on the equipments that agencies can rely upon, we can easily understand why it is unevenly distributed among them. 1238 {#economisation} {#power} {#platform-market}
