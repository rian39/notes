[w]e suggest using the term “economy of qualities” for this (dynamic) economy of the product (as opposed to a more static economy of the good) in which the modalities of the establishment of supply and demand, the forms of competition, are all shaped by the organized strategies deployed by the different actors to qualify goods. 35

These highly reflexive markets are organized around two structuring mechanisms: the singularization of goods and the attachment of goods to (and detachment from ) those who consume them. 35

This attachment to a singularized product cannot be disassociated from the configuration – through supply and demand – of an apparatus of distributed cognition in which information and reference are spread out between many elements. The consumer's preferences are tied into this apparatus. 38

It is through a reconfiguration of the socio-cognitive apparatus  .... that detachment and reattachment are effected. 39

In the economy of qualities, this struggle for attachment and detachment is at the heart of competition. 40

very useful stuff on services ... how we become parts of the service via singularization

The establishment of distributed cognition devices, intended to organize real-life experiments on preferences, tends to blur habitual distinctions between production, distribution and consumption. Design, as an activity, that crosses through the entire organization, becomes central: the firm organizes itself to make the dynamic process of qualification and requalification of products possible and manageable. 45

The beneficiary and service provider cooperate closely in the singularization of the services proposed. 45
