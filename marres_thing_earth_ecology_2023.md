> First and foremost, as I already suggested, it points toward a “becoming environmental” of politics itself—its re-embedding in the world. As long as978 we understand politics as a process that only starts once people leave behind their living environments, and step outside the private realm with its con- straints and burdens of the reproduction of life—as classic conceptions of representative democracy have it—we will not understand political contestation

To quote Dewey once more: “The measure of a value a person attaches to a thing is not what he says about its preciousness, but the care he devotes to obtaining and using the means without which it cannot be attained” (Dewey [1908] 1955). However, this particular way of turning politics around things through care also raises tough questions for pragmatist politics itself, 978

This fundamental at-stakeness of the world itself is what the climate crisis, in particular, forces those of us who previously felt secure in their modern commitment to self-assertion—secure at least in that if not in other respects!—to recognize. 982

These ways of viewing climate change posited the problem on the aggregate level, in the abstract space of projected average temperatures, which ignored the immense variability in climate change situations as they unfold on the ground (see also Edwards 2013). To posit the climate problem on the scale of global temperatures is to establish a hierarchy of scale, one that suggests that only that which can be posited on the aggregate scale really matters. But, of course, adopting a logic of aggregation is not the only way to reach the conclusion that the ecological crisis puts the world itself at stake. There are many paths through which we may come to realize this, through experience, description, through ritual. However, the question for all those who have been gripped by the climate predicament remains: what politics of scale do we adopt, then, when we posit that the ecological crisis puts earth systems in danger?

The logic of “public controversy,” according to which socio- material conflicts (such as those caused by the construction of a high-speed rail link and the attendant destruction of a forest) occasion the articulation of mutually challenging, antagonistic attachments and points of view, and compel actors to stage their disagreements: this logic is today being lost, for many it has already been lost. Yes, the ecologies of ecological politics extend into media ecologies, institutions, and organizational ecologies. 989

When we adopt relational ontology as a perspective, as an orientation in the world, we realize how conflicted and conflictual our entanglement with others is. We do not only realize our connectedness, we realize how profoundly antagonistic and antagonizing our ways of being implicated in the world are. When we grasp—or even just glimpse—the destruction involved in all of this, destruction to the pos- sible point of obliteration (Cadena and Blaser 2018), all this gets a lot more problematic. Or rather, the situation is so bad that it’s not a problem anymore but a threat pure and simple. At whichever of these two levels we find ourselves, it is to realize our powerlessness in a new way: we are
not equipped to intervene.990

a politics that operates primarily through representa- tion, a politics in which representation trumps participation as a matter of course, is simply not equipped, not powerful enough, to activate the exis- tential proposition of the world-at-stake. 992
