In effect, the main result of scientific activity is not to produce information but to reconfigure heterogeneous networks.


If, for example, I wanted to talk about the network of Einsteinian physics (always assuming that it is unified in some way), then I would include articles, books, and textbooks that present and circulate its constitutive statements. But I would also include the equipment and machines in which it is inscribed, and skills embodied in human beings (physicists, chemists, and also college students who are struggling with Lorentz transforms). To this we should add the institutions that support and develop it: laboratories, government agen- cies, universities. This is today a sprawling network-admittedly fragile, but extended. 412

The reconfigurations produced by these collectives depend for the most part on elements that are brought together, on the local culture that they constitute. Problems posed, deciding between giving preference to experiments or theories, favoring certain types of explanation, aversion to or, on the contrary, interest in applications obviously depend on the identity of the elements making up the collective and on the organization of their interactions. Change the composition of the collective, and you change the content of its productions. 413

It is because sociologists and anthropologists have been able to unfold these pleats one by one that we have succeeded in perceiving the networks that are drawn together in these collectives. The variety of knowledge produced and its capacity to shake up networks made irreversible by the market will depend on the composition of these collectives. 415

Science is a public good when it can make a new set of entities proliferate and reconfigure the existing states of the world. Private science is the science that firms up these worlds, makes them habitable. This is why public and private science are complementary despite being distinct: each draws on the other. This definition is independent of the identity of the actors involved. A firm that funds diversity by supporting new collectives is producing a public good and the government agency that contributes to a yet stronger linkage between the research it funds and the perfecting of Tomahawk missiles are supporting a science that can doubtless be called private.  416

By relentlessly pursuing the task of charting diversity within an activity-science-that is generally accused of creating uniformity and destroying the wealth of traditional cultures, anthropology has made an important discovery. Science is a public good, which must be preserved at all costs because it is a source of variety. It causes new states of the world to proliferate. And this diversity depends on the diversity of interests and projects that are included in those collectives that reconfigure nature and society. Without it, without this source of diversity, the market- with its natural propensity to transform science into a commodity-would be ever more doomed to convergence and irreversibility. In the end, it would negate itself. Like Carnotâ€™s cycle, the economic machine can only function
with a source of heat and a source of cold! 418

How can one measure the degree of originality of a new collective? How can one help it grow without giving it too much support? How can one measure the degree to which it has been made irreversible? This could be the subject of another article. 418
