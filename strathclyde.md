‘Technology-driven and Model-driven approaches to Group Decision Support: focus, research philosophy and key concepts’

Rather than focusing on computing systems, the Model-driven tradition focuses on the different sorts of decision models (again, hence the label)  which may underlie a GDS methodology. 8

Model-driven researchers are more concerned about the transmission of their skills and tacit knowledge to potential practitioners of the methods 9

While the Technology-driven tradition seeks to diffuse its meeting support product, the Model-driven tradition seeks to provide a problem consultation service. 9

The commonest way of splitting up the "input factors" in the Technology-driven literature is to divide them into group, technology, task and context characteristics. 13

There is no strong positive conceptualization of "context" which is generally used as a residual class, where variables are parked when they are felt to be important but have received little systematic study (e.g. culture). 13

The other big difference between Technolog]-driven and the Model-driven traditions, relates to the roles of

To summarise the discussion thus far: we have argued that the Technology-driven and Model-driven 
Traditions originate in different fields – IS and OR – and are responses to different needs. This explains what is for us a fundamental difference between the two traditions: the focus on the computing system, on the one hand, and on the decision model on the other. This difference in focus in turn helps explain how the two fields see the measures of their success (and hence as their main challenges): while the Technology-driven tradition seeks to diffuse its meeting support product, the Model-driven tradition seeks to provide a problem consultation service. 9
