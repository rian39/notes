algorithmic architectures dynamically constitute
certain forms of social practice around the pursuit of visibility 2

Although Facebook encourages researchers to stay away from the platform as it only and inevitably offers a point of view that is biased, I want to suggest that rather than moving away from the platform, we should openly speak from within. By not letting the me- centricity of Facebook limit research into the closed and black-boxed spaces of commer- cial Web 2.0 platforms, we can start to accumulate and reassemble our individualized experiences of becoming visible in and through the power of the algorithm. 14

Given these new changes, what is needed is research that not only attends to changes in editorial media practices as increasingly delegated to algorithms, but also to the changes in cultural assumptions about the nature of social networking that are being built into algorithmic architectures. 15
