Global phenomena are not unrelated to social and cultural problems. But they have a distinctive capacity for decontextualisation and recontextualization, abstractability and movement, across diverse social and cultural situations and spheres of life. ... At the same time, the conditions of possibility of this movement are complex. Global forms are limited or delimited by specific technical infrastructures, administrative apparatuses, or value regimes, not by the vagaries of a social or cultural field. 11
