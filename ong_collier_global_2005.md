An assemblage is the product of multiple determinations that are not reducible to a single logic. The temporality of an assemblage is emergent. It does not always involve new forms, but forms that are shifting, information or at stake. 12 {#ensemble}

In conceptualizing the form taken by the actual global in these cases we might drawn on another image, that of a 'global variable' in a computer program. A global variable is not part of a step in a sequence in any given module but is executed independently. It is used by various parts or modules of a program, and has a common value across modules, acting as a point of communication or interaction among them. 13 {#coding} 

Global phenomena are not unrelated to social and cultural problems. But they have a distinctive capacity for decontextualisation and recontextualization, abstractability and movement, across diverse social and cultural situations and spheres of life. ... At the same time, the conditions of possibility of this movement are complex. Global forms are limited or delimited by specific technical infrastructures, administrative apparatuses, or value regimes, not by the vagaries of a social or cultural field. 11 {#ensemble}
