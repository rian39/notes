working with statistical learning machines can push us to think about novel structures and functions in our data. This awareness is often counterintuitive, and familiar methods such as simple correlations, or slightly more evolved partial correlations, are often not sufficience to pin down these deeper connections. 5-6

A statistical learning machine is a procedure that can potentially make good use of difficult data. And _if_ it is shown to be effective in making a good prediction about a clinical process or outcome, it can lead us to refeined understanding of that porcess: it can help us _learn_ about the process. 6

most of the procedures are reinforcing in their conclusions and are (often) nearly trivial to implement 6

logistic regression is the default "simple" model for predicting a subject's group status. ... it can be applied after a more complex learning machine has done the heavy lifting of identifying an important set of predictors given a very large list of candidate predictors. It could also be inlcuded as a "measurement" in a learning machine, so that predictions from one machine can be into the input for other machines.  43

The logistic regression model ... is a widely used statistical technique in biomedical data analysis, for a number of reasons. 91

Mastering the details of tree growth and management is an excellent way to understand the activities of learning machine generally. 118

Given data, a tree is generated by  first selecting a feature from the full list of features, and the selection is occurs at every node under consideration for splitting. Often the feature list is very big.  ... However, no distributional assumptions or other statistical premises are made in decision trees concerning the features or the subjects. 120

Selecting a single feature for consideration is done randomly from the full list of predictors. 120

Firstly, if the data has any signal at all then most machines will detect it. 257

we freely admit that many machines tudies in this text are somewhat mysterious, though powerful engines.  257
