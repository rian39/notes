Berlant, Cruel optimism, 2007

But the surrender to the return to the scene where the object hovers in its potentialities is the operation of optimism as an affective form 20 
Cruel optimism is the condition of maintaining an attachment to a problematic object in advance of its loss. 21
One makes affective bargains about the costliness of one’s attachments, usually unconscious ones, most of which keep one in proximity to the scene of desire/attrition. 21

These suspensions open up the “impasse” as a name for the transitional moment between a habituated life and all of its others. What happens in this space of time helps to explain why exuberant attachments keep ticking, not like the time bomb they might be but like a white noise machine that provides assurance that what seems like threat or static really is, after all, a rhythm 
people can enter into while they’re dithering, tottering, bargaining, testing, or otherwise being worn out by the promises that they have attached to in this world. 23

the emotional flooding in proximity to a new object can also produce a similar grasping toward stabilizing form, a reanchoring in the symptom’s predictability. 31

They are, here, only pieces of an argument about the centrality of optimistic fantasy to reproducing and surviving in zones of compromised ordinariness. And that is one way to take the measure of the impasse of living in the overwhelmingly present moment. 35

Berlant , nearly utopian 2007
From this point of view, instead of embracing ethics as a kind of emotional orthopedics of the political, we might also attend to the convolutions of attachment that involve a desire to stay proximate, no matter  what, to the potential openings marked out by fantasies of the good life, self- continuity, or unconflictedness. 297-8

this state of precarity means that the promises of upward mobility previously shared by working-class and migrant labourers in the United States and Europe now function fictionally. Instead, the promise of later happiness resonates as an empty dream that our attachments actually work to undermine, are indeed ‘a central part of the reproduction of the difficulty of their singular lives and lived struggle on the bottom of class society in the first place’ (Berlant, 2007a, p. 278). We agree to participate in a story about ‘the good life’ that substitutes for real social advancement in an era in which social relations are  ever more untethered. 

To endure, to keep on through time, is the only way of maintaining the possibility of a future; one has to endure to participate in restagings rather than repetitions. In addition, to stay in the game in order to do so is not perhaps so wildly optimistic a fantasy to close on, precisely because ‘staying attached to life involves gathering up diverse practices for adjusting to the singular and shared present’ (Berlant, 2011, p. 57). Attachments might provide glimpses of other ways of being, even if only temporarily, and these may become part of the history one takes forward as practices; in conjunction with the routine banalities reproductive repetition engenders, certainly, but still. 135

Or, then again, we might ask questions of statistics. For that is where, when it comes to it, the overwhelming majority of the socially most relevant ‘sex- differences’ are made. Not in the operation theatre, but on spread sheets. Not by cutting or pasting organs or injecting hormones, but by juggling with percentages. 343

Anticipation as we see it has multiple valences, epistemic value and is a virtue. Its politics are temporal and affective. It emerges at a moment of actuarial saturation, when one realizes that the sciences of the actual can be abandoned or ignored to be replaced by a knowledge that the truth about the future can be known by way of the speculative forecast, itself relying on proliferating modes of prediction. Speculative forecast, in turn, has been loosened from the virtue of certainty and redirected as an injunction to characterize and inhabit degrees and kinds of uncertainty – adjusting ourselves to routinized likelihoods, hedged bets and probable outcomes. Preparedness is infinitesimally possible and infinitely malleable when one has a good working model of an anticipated ‘future.’ 247

Crucially, the future increasingly not only defines the present but also creates material trajectories of life that unfold as anticipated by those speculative processes. Anticipation is rapidly reconfiguring technoscientific and biomedical practices as a totalizing orientation. 248

Anticipation herein also differs from speculation, even while it authorizes  speculative modes of engagement. Anticipation, as a lived condition or orientation, gives speculation the authority to act in the present. Anticipatory  regimes offer a future that may or may not arrive, is always uncertain and yet is necessarily coming and so therefore always demanding a response. 249

In anticipation, abduction also acquires a temporal form: the tacking back and forth between the past, present and future. Abduction moves reasoning temporally from data gathered about the past to simulations or probabilistic anticipations of the future that in turn demand action in the present. Abduction thrives in the vibrations between the is and the ought, consummately modern yet augmented by anticipation in ways that undermine the certainties on which modernity thrives. Abduction is the process of considering more precisely how to anticipate in actual practice. How is the present abducted by the future? 255

mark a shift from regimes of truth to regimes in which anticipation is formed through modes of prediction and instrumentality; 260
