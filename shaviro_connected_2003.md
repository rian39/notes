A network has no goal outside itself and therefore no objective measure of satiety. It strives only to maintain itself. But such self-maintenance is an endless task: a network's labor is never done. 11
So this is what it means to live in the network society. We have moved out of time and into space. Anything you want is yours for the asking. 249
The one real innovation of the network society is this:  surplus extraction is at the center of consumption as well as production. 249
What's missing is what is more than information: the qualitative dimension of experience or the continuum of analog space in between all those ones and zeroes. From a certain point of view, of course, this surplus is nothing at all. It is empty and insubstantial, almost by definition.  … But this nothing is precisely the point. Because of this nothing, too much is never enough, and our desires are never satisfied. 249-50
