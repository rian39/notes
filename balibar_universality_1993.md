Our experience with thinking and building institutions has been, however, that such integrative patterns are not able to “reconcile” or completely “mediate” the conflicting concepts and experiences of universality. 48

Real Universality produces a very ambivalent effect on this situations. It generalizes minority-status 53

Real Universality is a stage in history where, for the first time, “Humankind” as a single web of interrelations is no longer an ideal or utopian notion but an actual condition for every individual; nevertheless, far from representing a situation of mutual recognition, it actually coincides with a generalized pattern of conflicts, hierarchies and exclusions. 56

This is precisely what should be understood as (fictitious) universality: not the idea that the common nature of individuals is given or already there, but rather the fact that it is produced inasmuch as particular identities are relativized and become mediations for the realization of a superior and more abstract goal. 58

Within the boundaries of fictitious universality, a free individual ... has to be “normal” in several senses. 62

[n]obody can be properly emancipated from outside or from above, but only by his/her own collective activity. 66 {#freedom} {#participation}

Once we again realize that in politics there are realities, fictions, and ideals, but there are no essences. 69

the ideal universality is multiple by nature, not in the sense of being “relative,” less than unconditional, bound to compromising, but rather in the sense of being always already beyond any simple or “absolute” unity, therefore a source of conflicts forever. 72
