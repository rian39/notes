Under Biology's Hood. Q&A with Leroy Hood

http://www.technologyreview.com/magazine/sep01


There were three things that stood out in my mind about that first meeting. One was the enormous technological challenges the Human Genome Project presented, both in sequencing and mapping, but also in computation and analysis. The second thing that was exciting was to see how it would transform biology and medicine. I was an advocate for this project, and was there ever bitter opposition. Hostile, aggressive and negative interactions resulted. And the reason for that, which is the third thing that really impressed me, is the genome introduced to biology a completely new approach, which I've since come to call "discovery science." It's the idea that you take an object and you define all its elements and you create a database of information quite independent of the more conventional hypothesis-driven view.

First, discovery science is now an accepted concept. Second, the human genome has provided us with a genetics parts list for humans and the other model organisms whose genomes have been sequenced. We must do biology to figure out how these parts function, and now we have them—genes, control sequences, etc.—in databases. Third, the Human Genome Project has given us access to human variability, the genetic variations which make humans different from one another—different in physiology and different in disease predisposition. And it's in this arena that medicine will be utterly transformed over the next 20 years or so.

That is basically what systems biology is about. It is taking a biological system, identifying its elements, perturbing it in a model system, capturing information at the DNA, RNA, protein, protein interaction, informational pathway and informational network levels, and integrating and graphically displaying [that information], and then developing mathematical models that will describe the structure and behavior of the system.

It allows you to understand the system and how it functions. If you are a pharmaceutical company, it suggests that there are critical points in these informational networks at which one can begin to attack the system, manipulate it, circumvent the limitations of defective genes. We are at the earliest stages of learning how to do mathematical formulations. Once we do, I think it will transform how one identifies drug targets, how one deals with potential side effects of drugs, and how one determines whether a particular drug that has already been approved might do something else that is even more interesting

At the same time, we are attempting to develop software that is good for the visualization of biological complexity, software that can automate the process of building and optimizing the models. Obviously, we have to develop computational tools that will capture information from each of these different technologies.
