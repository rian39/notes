Nikolas Rose, The politics of life itself : biomedicine, power, and subjectivity in the twenty-first century, (Princeton, NJ, 2006).
The laboratory has become a kind of factory for the creation of new forms of molecular life. And in doing so, it is fabricating a new understanding of life itself. 13
Molecular genomics has depended upon the invention of a whole range of technologies for decomposing, anatomizing, manipulating, amplifying, and reproducing vitality at this molecular level – from the DNA binding dyes that made large chromosomal structures visible under the microscope …. Combined together, in extraordinary subtle ways, these techniques opened “the gene” to knowledge and technique at the molecular level. 14
Whether it is the transfer of genes along with their properties – luminescence, salt tolerance – from one species to anohter, or the transfer of tissues, blood plasma, kidneys, stem cells, molecularization is conferrring a new mobility on the elements of life, enabling them to enter circuits – organic, interpersonal, geographical and financial. 15
But contemporary biology operates, at least in part, in a “flattened” field of open circuits. 15
[I]n the interventions that proliferate in this flattened world, almost any vital elemetn can, in principle, be freed from its ties to cell, organ, organism, or species, set free to circulate and to be combined with any other, provided certain conditions are met. 16
Corporeal existence and vitality of the self has become the privileged site of experiments with the self (Rose 2006, 26)
Biopolitics today depends upon meticulous work in the laboratory in the creation of new phenomena, the massive computing power of the apparatus that seeks to link medical histories and family genealogies with genomic sequences, … It is here in the practices of contemporary biopower , that novel forms of authority are to be found. 28
Stuff on somatic experts as central to truth discourses of biology 29 
From the stem cell experts to the molecular gerontologists, from the neuroscientists to the technologists of cloning, new specialists of the soma have emerged, each with their own apparatus of associations, meetings, journals, esoteric languages, star performers and myths. Each of these is surrounded by, augmented by, a flock of popularizes, science writers and journalists. (Rose 2006, 29)
Key tension in contemporary biopolitics – intensifying somatic ethics in the West … and inequities and injustics of the local and global economic, technological and biomedical infrastructure required to support such a somatic ethic …
