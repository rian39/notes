True discourses were equipment to the extent that they had been assimilated thoroughly, made to  function as rational principles of action. 10

What I am attempting to do is to reflect on how it might be possible to transfigure elements of the equipment of modern method into a  form of modern meditation, and to bring the benefits and effects of that transformation to bear on enquiry. 12



How to think about things human is a problem. Most attempts to solve this problem deploy one or another answer that claims to offer generality and stability. These attempts have produced incompatible answers. The fact that there is a problem in thinking about human things, and that part of that problem lies in the inability to produce a stable solution, is coexistent and cotemporal with the practice itself. 4

A problematization, then, is both a kind of general historical and social situation-saturated with power relations, as are all situations, and imbued with the relational “play of truth and falsehood,” a diacritic marking a subclass of situations-as well as a nexus of responses to that situation. (19)

The defining trait of problematization does not turn on the couplings of opposites (outside or inside, free or constrained), but rather on the type of relationship forged between observer and problematized situation. 20

Apparatuses are the forms composed of heterogeneous elements that have been stabilized and set to work in multiple domains. 55

Events problematize classifications, practices, things. The problematization of classifications, practices, things is an event. A sensibility of constant change, and a certain pleasure and obligation to grasp it and participate in the transformations, constitute one mode of relating to things. This sensibility takes the mode of a keen awareness that the taken-for-granted can change, that new entities appear, that our practices of making are closely linked to those entities, that we name them, that we group them, that we experiment with them,  that we discover different contours when deploying questions and techniques. 67

Approaching composition as motion is one mode of creation. 71

Given that what I am seeking to understand, and establish a specific relationship to, are events, in a hypercomplex world, identified from a position that privileges problematizations, apparatuses, and assemblages, the question of narrative form requires its own specificity.  .... The narrative forms appropriate for such inquiry would (1) remain within and be oriented toward the actual; and (2) experiment with structures that lack closure 79

The result is one instantiation of a form .. that brings inquiry and equipment into a common discursive space. 79

The process that I am currently engaged in and seeking to name  ... concerns the emergence of form as a process, includes in an essential manner claims to say or see something true. The process that concerns me is the one in which such "knowledge-things" are being assembled 85

technicians of the tentative 87

it follows that if one's object is an anthropological account of a problematization, then one's informants will differ from each other. The challenge lies in finding an experiential and experimental site that would provide a contemporary instance. 87

For, in thinking through problems, ... the one who inquires "expects to transform himself, at the mercy of the resistances that he must surmount." No doubt this process creates a certain malaise. The challenge is not to get ride of this affect but to find ways of living through it such that one's life attains, at least temporarily, though always in motion, a different relation to it. 120

I advocate pursuing in our thought and writing something like the motion, through different scales and different subject positions. ... Such movement is easy to initiate and hard to master. Yet I firmly believe that in the actual conjuncture of things, it is a paramount challenge for philosophy and the human sciences to experiment with forms that will be, if not fully adequate to, at least cognizant of, the need for such movement through scale and subjectivity. 135-6.
