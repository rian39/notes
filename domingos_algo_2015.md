Learning algorithms -- also known as learners -- are algorithms that make other algorithms. With machine learning, computers write their own programs, so we don't have to. 6 

We can think of machine learning as the inverse of programming in the same way that the square root is the inverse of the square or integration is the inverse of differentiation 7

In the information-processing ecosystem, learners are the superpredators. Databases, crawlers, indexers and so on are the herbivores, patiently munging on endless fields of data. 

Learning algorithms are the matchmakers: they find producers and consumers for each other, cutting through the information overload. 11

Even more astonishing than the breadth of applications of machine learning is that it's the _same_ algorithms doing all of these different things. 23

_All knowledge -- past, present,and future -- can be derived from data by a single, universal learning algorithm_ 25

Unlike the theories of a given field, which only have power within that field, the Master Algorithm has power across all fields. ... The Master Algorithm is the germ of every theory 47
