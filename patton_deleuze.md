Striated space encloses a surface, divides it up at determinate intervals, establishes breaks, whereas a smooth space involves distribution across a surface, by frequency or along paths' (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 481, trans. modified). 112 )

A meaningful politics of difference requires more than a simplistic formula about the relative priority of difference and identity. 46
It is because forces are of different ‘natural kinds', as 'well as different magnitudes' that he refers to the space in which forces confront one another as 'a non-place, a pure distance, which indicates that the adversaries do not belong to a common space' (Foucault 1977b: 85).
Forces are the potentials for acting and being acted upon which constitute bodies as bodies of a particular kind. 52
Relationship of forces constitutes a body - whether it is chemical, biological, social or political. Any two forces, being unequal, constitute a body as soon as they enter into a relationship' (Deleuze 1983: 40). (1P83) Nietzsche and Philosophy, trans. (1983) Nietzsche and Philosophy, trans. Hugh Tomlinson, London: Athlone Press.
Power's condition of possibility . . . is the moving substrate of force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly engender states of power' (Foucault 1978: ~3). 93
A body will increase in power to the extent that its capacities to affect and be affected become more developed and differentiated (Deleuze 1983: 62) . 74
The socius takes different forms according to the means of codification of flows CflC 8 p 89
With the emergence of capitalism, society passes from a regime of code surplus to a regime of flow surplus (Deleuze and Guattari 1577: 228). 93
The real characteristics of axiomatics that lead us to say that capitalism and present-day politics are an axiomatic the 'literal sense' (Deleuze and Guattari 1987: 461). 94
Whereas a code establishes a systematic correspondence directly between elements of different signifying systems, an axiomatic system is defined by purely syntactic rules for the generation of strings of non-signifying or uninterpreted symbols. 94
