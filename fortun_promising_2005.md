I did not remain open to the promise, to a future still to come—maybe—that would not simply repeat the past and present. 158

But it’s precisely because promising is always open to such ‘infelicities’, as J.L. Austin (1962) has put it, that I think inventing an ethics of promising is so vital for our future engagements with genomics. 158 {#participation}

Nietzsche’s promise, science’s promise, is not an anchoring device. The ‘being of exceeding’ is a different kind of promise than the Arendtian one; it operates not through establishing certainty, but through the risky affirmation of a recurring, iterative opening rather than anchoring of a future. This promise is implicated in the inhuman innards of technoscience. This promise is a fragment of the future implicated in the hidden folds of the present, freeing it rather than anchoring it. This promise is a chip of futural excess, invisibly disrupting the reproduction of the same, to experiment on the new. Science becomes such that it always seeks its own preemption, always promises to exceed itself, always makes it possible to always go beyond. 165 {#prediction} {#ensemble} {#device}

These are scientists whose daily work and thought occurs within this culture of excess, a culture of always going- beyond, a culture of promisings. Astonishment is a regular feature of this genomics landscape, and that is something that needs to be ethnographically reckoned with.166

By the same token, genomics can be considered a domain of ethical practice, its acts also occurring within a field of excessive forces. 166

Or more accurately: a bioethical form of relation that can give the genomicist the right to make promises about the future truths of the life sciences. ‘Care of the data’ is my shorthand for that relation, which of course also involves forming a particular kind of self capable of establishing or undergoing that relationship. 167

Having a right to make promises will have entailed learning to live with, and cultivate, the excesses of promising. Promising, and promising genomics in particular, is a matter of excess—the excess of biological matter as much as anything else. An organism like you, me, or a zebrafish, exceeds its genetic ‘code’. 171

Organisms, illnesses, events, politics, ethics, technological development—all of these are matters of for an ethics of promising 171 {#platform-future}

excess, that happen without our full understanding or control, as the cumulative, emergent effect of a multiplicity of forces: promises— . . .171-2
