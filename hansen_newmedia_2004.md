Insofar as the sensorimotor nexus of the body opens it to its own indeterminacy, it is directly responsible for the body's constitutive excess over itself. In this respect, motion functions as the concrete trigger of affection as an active modality of bodily action. 7

Rather, the image becomes a merely contingent configuration of numerical values that can be subjected to “molecular” modification, that lacks any motivated relation to any image-to-follow, and indeed that always already contains all potential images-to-follow as permutations of the set of its “elementary” numerical points. 8 {#images} {#numbering}

In sum, the image can no longer be restricted to the level of surface appearance, but must be extended to include the entire process by which information is made perceivable through embodied experience. 9

No matter how “black-boxed” an image technology (or technical frame) may seem, there will always have been embodied perception at/as its origin. 9 

[W]e must accept that the image, rather than finding instantiation in a privileged technical form (including the computer interface), now demarcates the very process through which the body, in conjunction with various apparatuses for rendering information perceptible, gives form to or in-forms  information. 10

[R]ather than selecting preexistent images, the body now operates by filtering information  directly and, through this process, creating images. 11

This means that with the flexibility brought by digitization,  there occurs a displacement of the framing function of media interfaces back onto the body from which they themselves originally sprang. 22

Viewed in this way, the digital era and the phenomenon of digitization itself can be understood as demarcating a shift in the correlation of two terms: media and body. Simply put, as media lose their material specificity, the body takes on a more prominent function as a selective processor of information. 22

putting the body to work (even in quite minimal ways) has the effect of conferring reality on an experience, of catalyzing the creation of a singular affective experience, that is, one that is qualitatively different from (but that can be deployed to supplement) the “verisimilitude” or “illusion” of the cinematic image. 39

Rather than marking the obsolescence of framing as such ... the flexibility constitutive of  digital images operates a modification of the time-image, a new mode of framing or the actualizing of the virtual: specifically, it resituates the source of the virtual from the interstices between (series of) images to interstices within  the image itself. In a sense, it incorporates the virtual within the actual, making the image the source of an infinite number of potential alternate framings – a limitless generation of other images from any part of itself. 75

Since technical circuits and images are nothing but concrete actualizations of a transpatial equipotentiality, they are necessarily infused with specific affective tonalities and thus with irreducible “traces” of human embodiment. 85

Just as it is embodied reception that introduces meaning into information, it is the transpatial axiological synthesis that virtualizes the digital infrastructure, transformings its merely formal or abstract permutations into a host of potentially meaningful “messages” - messages capable of triggering the creative force of bodily affectivity. 91

[M]achinic processes have fundamentally altered the infrastructure of our contemporary lifeworld in ways that directly impact our embodied experience. 236

Varela's account furnishes the mechanism for machine time to affect time-consciousness:as constitutive elements of what we might call a microphysical temporal object, the elementary events (at the 1/10 scale) of a machinic event, which are subperceptual, can trigger neural processes at this same microphysical scale, which are themselves likewise subperceptual. 251

[M]achine time can, in some sense, be said to enlarge the frame of the now itself. For if the exposure to machine time functions to stimulate neural dynamics and ultimately to trigger the emergence of new “nows,” then it might legitimately be said to contaminate the now with “elementary elements” that are properly inhuman. 252

As a process that is properly subperceptual, the constitution of a temporal object from microphysical machinic fluxes furnishes time-consciousness with a “content” that is not given – and that in principle cannot be given – by an impression.
