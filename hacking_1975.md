He was the first philosopher of probability. 57

We have distinguished, on the one had, the epistemic probability that some possibility is realized, and the aleatory or physical propensity for some possibility to exist. In modern opinion the latter exists, so far as we know, only for a fairly small range of chance set-ups. But in Leibniz's opinion every possibility has a propensity to exist. 137 {#probability} {#ensemble}

What is facile _in re_ corresponds to what is probable _in mente_. 138

On the one hand we have degrees of makeability _in re_, which we may gloss as tendencies to produce stable frequencies. These are the basis of probabilities _in mente_. 139
