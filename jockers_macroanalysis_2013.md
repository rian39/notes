To test the predictive power of each metadata category, the Nearest Shrunken Centroid (Tibshirani et.al. 2003) classification algorithm was employed. The NSC is a subtype of 'nearest centroid' algorithms that begin by computing a standard centroid for each class, calculating the average frequency for a feature in each class, and then dividing by the in-class standard deviation for that feature. 79-80

Although the NSC was developed to aid int he diagnosis of cancer types through the analysis of gene-expression data, it has been shown to perform well in stylistic analysis, especially so in authorship attribution (...) From a statistical perspective, the two types of problems (genetic and stylistic) are similar: both are composed of high-dimensional data, and the linguistic features are roughly analogous to the individual genes. 80

If the statistics are rather too complex to summarize here, I think it is fair to skip the mathematics and focus on the end results. We needn't know how long and hard Joyce sweated over _Ulysses_ to appreciate his genius, and a clear understanding of the LDA machine is not required in order to see the beauty of the result. 124
