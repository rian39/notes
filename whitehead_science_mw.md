# Whitehead, Science and the Modern World

In a certain sense, everything is everywhere at all times. For every location involves an aspect of itself in every other location. Thus every spatio-temporal standpoint mirrors the world. 114

'Value' is the world I use for the intrinsic reality of an event.  ... We have only to transfer to the very texture of realisation in itself that value which we recognise so readily in terms of human life. 116

The aboriginal data in terms of which pattern weaves itself are the shapes, of sense-objects, and of other eternal objects whose self-identity is not dependent on the flux of things 187-8

The volume is the most concrete element of space. But the separative character of space, analyses a volume into sub-volumes, and so on indefinitely. Accordingly, taking the separative character in isolation, we should infer that volume is a mere multiplicity of non-voluminous elements, of points in fact. But it is the unity of volume which is the ultimate fact of experience, 80-81

standpoint every other part, is something in relation to it. Thus if A and B and C are volumes of space, B has an aspect from the standpoint of A, and so has C, and so has the relationship of B and C. This aspect of B from A is of the essence of A. The volumes of space have no independent existence. They are only entities as within the totality; you cannot extract them from their environ¬ ment without destruction of their very essence. 81

Whitehead says that volumes cannot be divided.

This difficulty arises because space-time cannot in reality be considered as aself-subsistent entity. It is an abstraction, and its explanation requires re¬ ference to that from which it has been extracted. Space-time is the specification of certain general characters of events and of their mutual ordering. 82

And space-time is an abstraction anyway. 

So Whitehead develops prehension pre-cog:

The things which are grasped into a realised unity, here and now, are not the castle, the cloud, and the planet simply in themselves; but they are the castle, the cloud, and the planet from the standpoint, in space and time, of the prehensive unification. In other words, it is the perspective of the castle over there from the standpoint of the unification here. It is, therefore, aspects of the castle,  the cloud, and the planet which are grasped into unity here.87

It is necessary to understand that space-time is nothing else than a system of pulling together of assemblages into unities. But the word event just means one of these spatio-temporal unities. Accordingly, it may be used instead of the term ‘prehension’ as meaning the thing prehended. An event has contemporaries. This means that 91

## the nineteenth century

If we are to include the secondary qualities in the com¬ mon world, a very drastic reorganisation of our fundamental concept is necessary. It is an evident fact of experience that oui apprehensions of the external world depend absolutely on the occurrences within the human body. By playing appropriate tricks on the body a man can be got to perceive, or not to perceive, almost anything. 113

Amazing discussion here of Wordsworth vs Shelley; WOrdsworth does enduring, Shelley does change; W rejects science, S builds poems around it.
