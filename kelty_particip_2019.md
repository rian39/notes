The rise of the apps, instruments, devices, platforms, and especially algorithms is said to enable new possibilities for human development and progress today. Over the last ten years, the enthusiasm for such devices and tools has only seemed to intensify as people have taken the fire of participation and transformed it into algorithms, platforms, apps, and websites meant to facilitate and scale it up, so that it might move quickly around the world to wherever it might be needed. So, too, has the skepticism of participation and even outright rejection of it grown. But such devices and procedures do not always end in extractive platform capitalism, even if that appears to be their routine fate: sometimes they also end up in our administrative institutions, our educational practices, and our well-­meaning social movements. 13 {#participation}

These procedures of participation, therefore, are also ways of making up people . The more participation is forthis matted as a procedure involving contributory autonsociety, omy, the more precise are the forms of personhood it rework. quires; and the more precise they are, the easier it is for people to reflect on these demands. 16 {#subject}


The collective is not identified with the individual or sustained as such, but is more like a container or medium within which individuals are encompassed temporarily. This feature of contemporarary participation is perhaps most clearly evident in the platforms of social media engagement: it is in these contexts that an individual is asked to be an individual who participates in an infinite series of collectives , mediated by algorithms that display the outlines of these collectives according to opaque procedures and interests— ­ outlines that shift faster than human perception or consciousness can apprehend. What on the surface appears to be an overflowing surplus of sociality or collectivity might be just the opposite: not alienation or isolation, but an unsupportable demand to contribute to a constantly shifting, unending collectivity.17-18.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the practice of arranging and formatting participation is not itself open to participation by everyone. The practices of design, redesign and engineering, or maintenance of our platforms, devices, infrastructures, and technologies are obviously activities cordoned off from the involvement of just anyone, confined to particular people, corporations, governments. One critique of this confinement is that it is neither neutral nor apolitical, that it is neither prior to nor separate from the design of our political systems, but fundamentally involved in it. However, the same can be said of critique itself— i ­ 250 {#elite}

The value of this formatting is in its computability: the software, devices, and algorithmic tools of the present necessitate this kind of formatting in order to take advantage of the power they bring. Algorithms and big data are generally pointless in a context of messy, unstructured speech among a handful of people. But if they are given lots of structured data to work with, their power starts to become more obvious. Formatting participation in the present is not just a question of tool kits, scripts, or games, but also of objects like “stacks,” “frameworks,” and “dashboards” that allow the participation of users to be formatted and made visible. Tool kits remake the world in their own image: scalable, modular, automatic, fast, and mobile. Tool kits ease the conversion of the unstructured mess of social lives into the phantasmatic virtual collectives made of data. In the context of such large-­scale platforms, participation is formatted in complex and precise ways to enable abstraction and extraction. I draw attention in this book to how that kind of formatting has been under way for decades, in different times and places, culminating in things like participatory management schemes, participatory 253 {#developers} {#devices}

Under the conditions of social media, cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence, something troubling happens to the nature of collectives. At first, one might assume that they simply bring all these small-­scale collectives together into one big one— ­making the world more open and connected, as Facebook would say. But what these platforms produce through individual participation is not a collective totality; it is not one big collective in which all participate and by which all are dominated; it is neither totalitarianism nor the tyranny of the majority. Rather, what it produces is a constant, unstable, infinite series of collectives; collectives that change constantly in their make-­ up and relationality; collectives that are unbounded; collectives that are perplexing to experience and difficult to make sense of. Collectives that change obscurely, and often outside of human perceptibility. The infinite series of collectives that large-­ scale mediated participation creates means that the personhood of those who inhabit them is similarly unstable. The question of how we relate to such collectives as persons, what we expect them to do, and what we ourselves think we should do in them, has been rendered quite dramatically uncertain. In this context I think Lévy-­ Bruhl’s notion of participation is helpful. Lévy-­ Bruhl offered participation as a tool to make sense of the existence of immediate, affective, and ethical intuition common to very different collectives, an existence that becomes visible through cases of perplexity. These shared intuitions were part and parcel of, and depended upon, the collective(s) within which they 261 {#collective} {#participation}

If one follows out this logic about the nature of ethical personhood, then perhaps it makes sense of why the contemporary embrace of new digital media is so perplexing: social media place us not in any particular collective (that of “white people” or “Facebook,” say), but in something like an infinite or unbounded collective, by virtue of its constant change. It is not a collective of “everyone,” but nor is it ever a specific collective of relations, save possibly for those brief moments when a keyword temporarily stabilizes a collective into a movement or an organization, such as Black Lives Matter.6 Similarly, the advent of the algorithmic constitution of these collective relations, and their “improvement” by machine learning or artificial intelligence, introduces new levels of unseeability and unpredictability into those collectives. If participation depends on the ability to apprehend and experience participation as a seeing-­ oneself-­participate, or knowing that one’s voice has been heard, this implies the capacity to know the contours of these relations and their extent. If that is lacking, the only available experience will be that of perplexity. It does not seema 262 {#ambivalence} {#positive}

And this means, finally, that it becomes impossible to experience participation. We are perpetually on the verge of understanding how to create ourselves as collectives, only to forget as soon as we become individuals. 264 {#subject} {#ambivalence}
