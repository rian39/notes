The forces that explain the circulation transformation of things are the same forces that give things value. In short, things circulate because they are valued and it is because they are valued that they become goods (Dewey, 1915). Circulation consists of an essentially dual process involving continuous requalification and valuation. 389 {#circulation}{#economisation}

The issue is no longer to distinguish, demarcate and to contrast regimes such as reciprocity, redistribution or market transactions. Instead, the goal is to understand how complex and hybrid social configurations are perpetually being constructed through the conjoined contributions of circulating material entities, as well as competent agents engaged in valuation practices 390 {#economisation}

An inventory and analysis of the investments required to transform entities from entangled beings into passive things is a key issue for the study of marketization. 6 {#economisation} {#platform-market} {#method}

The question of commodification has taken on a new salience due to the proliferation of ‘ living’  entities that have become candidates for marketization. Things such as genes, proteins, embryonic cells, GMOs and so on, currently being produced in laboratories through biomedical practices, raise difficult problems in terms of economic framing. 6

The assembly of devices and procedures that are necessary to make appropriation possible constitutes another prime subject in the study of marketization. 7 {#platform-market} {#ensemble}

In comparison with other possible forms of economization, marketization’s key characteristic is that a multiplicity and diversity of actors compete to participate in defining goods and valuing them. From an empirical point of view, the most visible and well-known forces that set markets in motion are firms, trades unions, state services, banks, hedge funds, pension funds, individual consumers and consumer unions and NGOs. To be more complete we could also mention the public- and private-sector research centres that prepare new products and processes, the international monetary or financial institutions, the regulatory or standardization agencies (whether they concern hard technologies or social technologies such as accounting rules and practices), as well as experts, lawyers, economists, think-tanks and other spin doctors. 8 {#economisation} {#platform-market} {#ensemble}

IMPORTANT DISCUSSION OF AGENCEMENT AND ITS INCLUSION OF DIVERSITY OF ACTORS

The know-how, practices and methods that contribute to calculation, however, are not limited to accounting techniques. They also include activities that exist in both the academic and business worlds, such as the so-called management sciences (on marketing, see Cochoy, 1998). The exploration of management tools, the disciplines, as well as the more or less formalized knowledge and know-how equipping firms (like strategic planning or operational research) must be pushed forward. Such research has to go beyond the supply side, to include the calculating equipment of the intermediaries and of consumption-related agencies. The existence of powerful consumer unions, the active role of users in the design of products intended for them and the social movements promoting fair trade are all arguments for research on the calculating forces of consumption (Mallard, 2007). 11 {#numbering} {#economisation}

We suggest the term ‘ valorimeters’  to denote the various tools, procedures, machines, instruments or, more generally, devices effecting this controversial translation of values into figures and, more precisely, into monetary amounts (Maurer, 2006). Calculative agencies which are able to achieve the imposition of their valorimeters, that is, their numeric calculation tools and algorithms, with their calculatory modes have a good chance of simultaneously being able to impose prices that those tools make it possible to calculate; they become positioned to transform their own valuation into an obligatory passage point and can spread the definitions of value that are more closely aligned with their interests (Guyer, 2004). The study of marketization that we propose is keenly interested in these valorimeters. It focuses on their design (by agents and/or by social scientists and especially economists, marketing professionals, experts in accounting or in the evaluation of costs and in management control), their implementation and their use, whether these prices correspond or not to the transactions actually carried out. 17

The upsurge of economic experimentation (both in vitro  and in vivo ) is strongly related to a transformation of the modelling itself, which in certain respects has become closer to simulation (Collier, 2008). The models are intended less to stylize and purify reality (Breslau, 2003) than to reproduce its complexity and richness (the same shift can be observed in the natural sciences). 20

Marketization becomes a dominant modality of economization. If the dynamics of economic markets are to be understood, then they must be placed within the context of broader movements that bring the economic into being. This is the complete message of 22
