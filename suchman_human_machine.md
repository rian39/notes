"the interface" becomes the name for a category of contingently enacted cuts occurring _within_ sociomaterial practices, that effect "person" and "machine" as distinct entities, and that in turn enable particular forms of subject-object interactions. At the same time, the singularity of "the interface" explodes into a multiplicity of more and less closely aligned, dynamically configured moments of encounter within sociomaterial configurations, objectified as persons and machines. 268

It is the privileged machine in this context that creates its marginalized human others. 269

Initiatives to develop a relational, performative account of sociomaterial phenomena indicate a different project. This project is based in recognition of the particularities of bodies and artifacts, of the cultural-historical practices through which human-machine differences are (re-)iteratively drawn, and of the possibilities for and politics of redistribution across the human machine boundary 285
