A statement always represents a transmission of elements distributed in a common space. .. the formations and transformations of these spaces themselves pose topological problems 3

What counts is the regularity of the statement: it represents not the average, but rather the whole statistical curve. 4

no statement can have a latent existence 16

science implies certain thresholds beyond which statements attain an 'epistemologization', a 'scientificity' or even a 'formalization' 19

science is concentrated in an area of knowledge it does not absorb and in a formation which is in itself the object of knowledge and not of science. Knowledge [savoir] in general is not science or a even a particular corpus of knowledge 19

power is local because it is never global, but it is not local or localized because it is diffuse 26. 

power has no essence; it is simply operational 27 {#power}

'a diagram' 'a functioning, abstracted from any obstacle ... or friction' 34
(this in the context of seeing how matter and function are formed'

every diagram is intersocial and constantly evolving. It never functions in order to represent a persisting world but produces a new kind of reality, a new model of truth. ... It makes history by unmaking preceding realities and significations, constituting hundreds of points of emergence or creativity, unexpected conjunctions or improbable continuums.35 {#diagram}

What is a diagram? It is a display of the relations between forces which constitute power in the above conditions ... the diagram or abstract machine is the map of relations between forces, a map of destiny, or intensity, which proceeds by primary non-localizable relations and at every moment passes through every point 36 

all knowledge runs from an visible element to an articulable one, and vice versa 39 {#knowing}

the tools or material machines have to be chosen first of all by a diagram 39 {#diagram}

there is no diagram that does not also include, beside the points which it connects up, certain relatively free or unbound points, points of creativity, change and resistance, and it perhaps with these that we ought to begin in order to understand the whole picture. 44

knowledge is a practical assemblage, a 'mechanism' of statements and visibilities. 51 {#knowing}

a most original conception of the 'statement' which viewed it as a function that crosses different unities, tracing a diagonal line more akin to music than to a signifying system. 52

these two halves of truth must enter into a relation, problematically, at the very moment when the problem of truth denies any possible correspondence or conformity between them. 64

it is between the statements and its conditions that visibilities insinuate themselves 66

statements and visibilities ... which grapple like fighters, force one another to do something or capture one another, and on every occasion constitute 'truth' 67 {#knowing} {#images}

'between the figure and the text we must admit a whole series of crisscrossings' 66 {#structure}
