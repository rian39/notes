A statement always represents a transmission of elements distributed in a common space. .. the formations and transformations of these spaces themselves pose topological problems 3

What counts is the regularity of the statement: it represents not the average, but rather the whole statistical curve. 4

no statement can have a latent existence 16

statements resemble dreams and are transformed as in a kaleidoscope, depending on the corpus in question and the diagonal line being followed. But in another sense he can also claim that he has written only what is real, and used what is real, for everything is real in the statement, and all reality in it is openly on display. 18

Above all, what we have done is to discover and survey that foreign land where a literary form, a scientific proposition, a common phrase, a schizophrenic piece of non-sense and so on are also statements, but lack a common denominator and cannot be reduced or made equivalent in any discursive way. This is what had never before been attained by logicians, formalists or interpreters. Science and poetry are equal forms of knowledge. 20

science implies certain thresholds beyond which statements attain an 'epistemologization', a 'scientificity' or even a 'formalization' 19

science is concentrated in an area of knowledge it does not absorb and in a formation which is in itself the object of knowledge and not of science. Knowledge [savoir] in general is not science or a even a particular corpus of knowledge 19

Whether discursive or not, formations, families and multiplicities are historical. They are not just compounds built up from their coexistence but are inseparable from 'temporal reactors of derivation'; and when a new formation appears, with new rules and series, it never comes all at once, in a single phrase or act of creation, but emerges like a series of 'building blocks', with gaps, traces and reactivations of former elements that survive under the new rules. Despite isomorphisms and isotopies, no formation provides the model for another. The theory of divisions is therefore an essential part of the system.32 One must pursue the different series, travel along the different levels, and cross all thresholds; instead of simply displaying phenomena or statements in their vertical or horizontal dimensions, one must form a transversal or mobile diagonal line along which the archaeologist- archivist must move. 21-22

power is local because it is never global, but it is not local or localized because it is diffuse 26. 

power has no essence; it is simply operational 27 {#power}

every diagram is intersocial and constantly evolving. It never functions in order to represent a persisting world but produces a new kind of reality, a new model of truth. ... It makes history by unmaking preceding realities and significations, constituting hundreds of points of emergence or creativity, unexpected conjunctions or improbable continuums.35 {#diagram}

What is a diagram? It is a display of the relations between forces which constitute power in the above conditions ... the diagram or abstract machine is the map of relations between forces, a map of destiny, or intensity, which proceeds by primary non-localizable relations and at every moment passes through every point 36 

all knowledge runs from an visible element to an articulable one, and vice versa 39 {#knowing}

the tools or material machines have to be chosen first of all by a diagram 39 {#diagram}

there is no diagram that does not also include, beside the points which it connects up, certain relatively free or unbound points, points of creativity, change and resistance, and it perhaps with these that we ought to begin in order to understand the whole picture. 44

knowledge is a practical assemblage, a 'mechanism' of statements and visibilities. 51 {#knowing}

Knowledge is a practical assemblage, a 'mechanism' of statements and visibilities. There is therefore nothing behind knowledge (although, as we shall see, there are things outside knowledge). That is to say that knowledge exists only according to certain widely varying 'thresholds' which impose particular layers, splits and directions on the stratum in question.51

a most original conception of the 'statement' which viewed it as a function that crosses different unities, tracing a diagonal line more akin to music than to a signifying system. 52

The light-being is a strictly indivisible condition, an a priori that is uniquely able to lay visibilities open to sight, and by the same stroke to the other senses, each time according to certain combinations which are themselves visible: for example, the tangible is a way in which the visible hides another visible. 59

The conclusion we can draw is that each historical for- mation sees and reveals all it can within the conditions laid down for visibility, just as it says all it can within the condi- tions relating to statements. 59

The spontaneity of language and the receptivity of light. Therefore it was not enough to equate receptive with passive and spontaneous with active. 60 


these two halves of truth must enter into a relation, problematically, at the very moment when the problem of truth denies any possible correspondence or conformity between them. 64

The archive, the audiovisual is disjunctive.64

it is between the statements and its conditions that visibilities insinuate themselves 66

statements and visibilities ... which grapple like fighters, force one another to do something or capture one another, and on every occasion constitute 'truth' 67 {#knowing} {#images}

'between the figure and the text we must admit a whole series of crisscrossings' 66 {#structure}

The statement has primacy by virtue of the spontaneity of its conditions (language) which give it a determining form, while the visible element, by virtue of the receptivity of its conditions (light), merely has the form of the determinable. Therefore, we can assume that de- termination always comes from the statement, although the two forms differ in nature. 67

heautonomy of the statement

each historical for- mation sees and reveals all it can within the conditions laid down for visibility, just as it says all it can within the conditions relating to statements. Nothing is every secret, even though nothing is ever immediately visible or directly readable. And in both cases the conditions do not meet deep within a consciousness or a subject, any more than they compose a single Entity: they are two forms of exteriority within which dispersion and dissemination take place,60 Foucault sometimes of statements, sometimes of visibilities. Language 'contains' words, phrases and propositions, but does not con- tain statements which are disseminated in accordance with certain irreducible distances. Statements are dispersed in accordance with their threshold and family. 60-1 

Foucault says that the visible figures and the signs of writing combine, but in a different dimension to that of their respective forms.3* In this way we must also leap into a different dimension to that of the stratum and its two forms, a third informal dimension that will take account both of the stratified composition of the two forms and of the primacy of the one over the other. What comprises this dimension, this new axis? 69

Therefore we should not ask: 'What is power and where does it come from?', but 'How is it practised?' An exercise of power shows up as an affect, since force defines itself by its very power to affect other forces (to which it is related) and to be affected by other forces. To incite, provoke and produce (or any term drawn from analogous lists) constitute active affects, while to be incited or provoked, to be induced to produce, to have a 'useful' effect, constitute reactive affects. 71

power to affect is like a function of force. But it is a pure function, that is to say a non-formalized function, independent of the concrete forms it assumes, the aims it serves and the means it employs: as a physics of action, it is a physics of abstract action. 72

We can therefore define the diagram in several different, interlocking ways: it is the presentation of the rela- tions between forces unique to a particular formation; it is the distribution of the power to affect and the power to be affected; it is the mixing of non-formalized pure functions and unformed pure matter. 73

Knowledge concerns formed matters (substances) and formalized functions, divided up segment by segment according to the two great formal conditions of seeing and speaking, light and language: it is therefore stratified, archivized, and endowed with a relatively rigid segmentarity. Power, on the other hand, is diagrammatic: it mobilizes non-stratified matter and functions, and unfolds with a very flexible segmentarity. In fact, it passes not so much through forms as through particular points which on each occasion mark the application of a force, the action or reaction of a force in relation to others, that is to say an affect like 'a state of power that is always local and unstable'. This leads to a fourth definition of the diagram: it is a transmission or distribution of particular features. 73

Power-relations are the differential relations which determine particular features (affects). The actualization which stabilizes and stratifies them is an integration: an operation which consists of tracing 'a line of general force', linking, aligning and homogenizing particular features, placing them in series and making them converge.10 Yet there is no im- mediate global integration. There is, rather, a multiplicity of local and partial integrations, each one entertaining an affinity with certain relations or particular points. 75 

The statement-curve integrates into language the intensity of the affects, the differential relations between forces, the particular features of power (potentialities). But visibilities must then also integrate these in a completely different way, into light. This is so much so that light, as a receptive form of  integration, must follow a comparable but non-corresponding path to that of language as a form of spontaneity. And the relation between the two forms at the heart of their 'non- relation' will be the two ways in which they fix the unstable relations between forces, localize and globalize diffusions, and regularize particular points. For visibilities, in the light of historical formations, form scenes which are to the visible element what a statement is to the sayable or readable. 79-80


In what sense is there primacy of power over knowledge, and of power-relations over relations of knowledge? The answer is that the latter would have nothing to integrate if there were no differential power relations. It is true that the former would fade and remain embryonic or virtual without the operations that integrate them; this is what leads to mutual pre- supposition. But if there is primacy it is because the two heterogeneous forms of knowledge are constituted by in- tegration and enter into an indirect relation, above and beyond their interstice or their 'non-relation', under conditions pertaining only to the forces. In this way the indirect relation between the two forms of knowledge does not imply any common form, or even a correspondence, but only the informal element of forces in which both are steeped.i 82
