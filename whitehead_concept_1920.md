What I am essentially protesting against is the bifurcation of nature into two systems of reality, which, in so far as they are real, are real in different senses.  30

bifurcate nature into two divisions, namely into the nature apprehended in awareness and the nature which is the cause of awareness. The nature which is the fact apprehended in awareness holds within it the greenness of the trees, the song of the birds, the warmth of the sun, the hardness of the chairs, and the feel of the velvet. The nature which is the cause of awareness is the conjectured system of molecules and electrons which so affects the mind as to produce the awareness of apparent nature. The meeting point of these two natures is the mind, the causal nature being influent and the apparent nature being effluent.31-32

Unless we produce the all-embracing relations, we are faced with a bifurcated nature ; namely, warmth and redness on one and molecules, electrons and ether on the other side. 32
