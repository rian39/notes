There are governance issues surrounding
the use of data, including those concerning
the sources of data, and the purposes for
which it is used. For this, a new framework
for data governance – one that can keep
pace with the challenge of data governance
in the 21st century – is necessary to address
the novel questions arising in the new digital
environment. The form and function of such a
framework is the basis of a study by the Royal
Society and British Academy. 12

It is not appropriate to set up governance
structures for machine learning per se. While
there may be specific questions about the use
of machine learning in specific circumstances,
these should be handled in a sector-specific
way, rather than via an overarching framework
for all uses of machine learning; some sectors
may have existing regulatory mechanisms that
can manage, while in others there may not be
these existing systems 12

key requirements
• Enabling the use of machine learning in
extracting value from data, through a data
environment that draws on open standards
and open data principles;
• Building a skills base and research environment that can provide the human
and technical capital to both apply and
further develop machine learning; and
• Creating governance systems to address
the key social and ethical challenges raised
by data in the 21st century. 18

Steps to increase machine learning literacy
from a young age may therefore include:
• K ey concepts in machine learning being
introduced as part of the computing
curriculum, with students interacting with
or coding machine learning algorithms in
practical classes (see Box 2, for examples
of where and how these concepts can
be taught).
• I  nsights from machine learning – or examples of how these systems work –
being used in science classes or in
non-scientific disciplines.
• D iscussions about key ethical concepts in
machine learning, and the governance of
access to personal data, in ethics classes.
• C ode Club modules which enrich students’
understanding of machine learning by
showing how machine learning algorithms 65

As it is put to use in this new environment, machine
learning reframes existing questions about
privacy, the use of data, and the applicability
of governance systems designed in an
environment of information scarcity. 90

Questions about consent are further
complicated by how ownership of different
data types is perceived. Discussions in terms
of ‘my data’ may lead to a data governance
model based on specific consent, but does not
reflect that much of the value of data comes
from its combination, or, in the case of machine
learning, in its use training an algorithm. 91

In considering issues related to governance
of machine learning it is important to
emphasise from the outset that by governance
we include the whole configuration of legal,
ethical, professional, and behavioural norms
of conduct, conventions and practices that,
taken together, govern the collection, storage,
use, and transfer of data. It is also helpful to
distinguish two separate, but related, spheres.
The first is in relation to the way in which
machine learning algorithms make use of,
and interact with, data sets upon which they
are trained. As already noted, the power and
extent of machine learning challenge many
current notions around privacy, consent and
appropriate data use. The second sphere
relates to questions around the properties of
the resulting algorithms, after they have been
trained on data, including safety, reliability,
interpretability, and responsibility.98
