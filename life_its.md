The transposition of 'living physiology' into lexis, or text, comprises a shift of a particular kind: an axial transposition in the temporal and spatial orientation of life itself. If the modern definition of life itself derives, as Foucault suggests, from the Darwinian Model of life as a unified, consanguineous, interconnected system, then that system depended upon descent as its orientating axis, or even as its telos. In sum, genealogical descent is the vertical spine of the Darwinian model of life itself. 218

This process can be described as the respatialisation of genealogy. Whereas, in the Darwinian model, genealogical order is the very order of life itself, in the post-Darwinian ars recombinatoria of the human genome project, genealogy is densely artefactual. 218

As it is, in a sense, flattened by the power of recombinant genetic technology to mix and match across species with the entire living lexical encyclopedia of proteins, enzymes and plasmid vectors to choose from, so genealogy is also re-temporalised after the fact of transgenic organisms such as OncoMouse. 219
