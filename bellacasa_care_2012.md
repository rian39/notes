Yet care is too important a notion to reduce it to hegemonic ethics (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2010; Latimer and Puig de la Bellacasa, forthcoming). Thinking in the world involves acknowledging our own involvements in perpetuating dominant values, rather than retreating into the secure position of an enlight- ened outsider who knows better. 197

But if care is a doing, is there a practical feature of this form of caring? 202

Writing-with is a practical technology that reveals itself as both descriptive (it inscribes) and speculative (it connects). It builds relation and community, that is: possibility. 203

In other words, where there is relation there has to be care, but our cares also perform disconnection. We cannot possibly care for everything, not everything can count in a world, not everything is relevant in a world – there is no life without some kind of death. However, thinking with care compels us to look at thinking and knowing from the perspective of how our cuts foster relationship, more than how they isolate figures 204

Although this assertion refers to inter-species love, its acknowledgement of interdependency offers a generic warning against idealized forms of caring. For living with is laborious. Relations of otherness are more than about accommodating ‘difference’, co-existing or tolerating. Thinking with should always be a living with, aware that relations of significant otherness transform those who relate and the worlds they live in. 207

We can try to think from, think for, and even think with, but living-with requires more than that. To attempt to multiply the ways of ‘access’, not just to think-for the perpetuated absent. To not confuse care with mere empathy, or with becoming the spokespersons of those discarded. Creating situated knowledge might also mean that thinking from and for particular struggles require us to work for change from where we are, rather than drawing upon them for my building of a new theory and for my continued inclusion in educated conversations. 209
