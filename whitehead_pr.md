A feeling in which the forms exemplified in the datum concern geometrical, straight, and flat loci will be called a 'strain.' In a strain, qualitative elements, other than the geometrical forms, express themselves as qualities implicated in those forms 310

It is the mark of a high-grade organism to eliminate, by negative prehension, the irrelevant accidents in its environment, and to elicit massive attention to every variety of systematic order. 317

act of experience arising out of data. It is a process of 'feeling' the many data 231, 40-1
feelings have vector quality 231

A prehension reproduces in itself the general characteristics of an actual entity: it is referent to an external world, and in this sense will be said to have a 'vector character'; it involves emotion, and purpose, and valuation, and causation. 19

Feelings are 'vectors'; for they feel what is there and transform it into what is here 87

Thus 'emotion' is 'emotional feeling' and what is felt is the presupposed vector situation. In physical science this principle takes the form which should never be lost sight of in fundamental speculation, that scalar quantities are constructs derivative from vector quantities. 212
