Surely this must be a primary task for critical enquiry – to uncover and probe the moments that come together in the making of a calculation that will automate all 11future decisions. To be clear, I am not proposing some form of humanist project of proper ethical judgement, but rather calling for attention to be paid to the specific temporalities and norms of algorithmic techniques that rule out, render invisible, other potential futures.

It is also what is ethical about political life – that it is difficult, to decide is difficult, and that whether mathematician „deciding the best set of rules‟, software analyst „refining the algorithm‟, or border guard „engaging action‟, a decision that is not simply the reading off of risk flag or protocol can only proceed without recourse to what is projected in the flags, maps and scores of the data derivative.
