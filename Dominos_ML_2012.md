Also, machine learning is not a one-shot process of building a dataset and
running a learner, but rather an iterative process of running the learner,
analyzing the results, modifying the data and/or the learner, and repeating.
Learning is often the quickest part of this, but that is because we have
already mastered it pretty well! Feature engineering is more difficult
because it is domain-specific, while learners can be largely general purpose.
However, there is no sharp frontier between the two, and this is another
reason the most useful learners are those that facilitate incorporating
knowledge. 84



Machine learning is not magic; it cannot get something from nothing. What it
does is get more from less. Programming, like all engineering, is a lot of
work: we have to build everything from scratch. Learning is more like
farming, which lets nature do most of the work. Farmers combine seeds with
nutrients to grow crops. Learners combine knowledge with data to grow
programs. [[@domingos_few_2012, 81]
