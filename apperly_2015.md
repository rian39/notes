> Is there a media archaeology of platforms? The question of what stabilizes the notion of a platform as part of the seriality of the theory methods, and what are the implicit, unarticulated themes that drive the notion are particularly important for the ongoing viability of platform studies as a method. Our interest resides in excavating the implicit conditions of platform studies, and conceptualizing how they resonate in media archaeology. Some theoretical strands of so-called German media theory has been strategically hesitant to identify with the Anglo-American traditions of cultural or media studies and insisting on the peculiar specificity of context. However, as we can see from recent innovative developments in media studies which include software and platform studies, the identification of technical specificity as a core issue in media scholarship is no longer limited to ‘‘quirky’’ European media theory [@Apperly_2015, 16]
