what happens when we take erosion, breakdown, and decay, rather than novelty, growth and progress, as our starting points in the thinking through the nature, use, and effects of information technology and new media.  Broken world thinking is both normative and ontological, in the sense  that it makes claims about the nature of technology and its relationship to broader social worlds, some of which may differ from deep-rooted cultural assumptions. 221  {#thought} {#repair}

There are two basic components of the approach advocated here. The first is an appreciation of the real limits and fragility of the worlds we inhabit -- natural, social, and technological -- and a recognition that many of the stories and order of modernity ... are in the porcess of coming apart, perhaps to be replaced by new and better stories and orders, but perhaps not. 221

Repair is about space and function -- the extension of safeguarding of capabilities in danger of decay. 223

behind and prior to the origin stands the fix 223

breakdown, maintenace and repair constitute crucial but vastly understudied sites of moments with the worlds of new media and technology today. ... the productivist bias of the field obscures this fact 226 {#thought} {#platform-foundation} {#repair}

the _efficacy_ of innovation in the world is limited -- until extended, sustained and completed in repair. The remarkable qualities and energies that innovations names and unleases -- creativity, invention, imagination, and artfulness -- are therefore distributed more broadly in the technology landscape than our dominant discourses of innovation and the systems of economic, professional, and social value build around are keen to acknowledge. 227
