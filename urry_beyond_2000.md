Much of our understanding of society and social life is based upon, and reflected through, various metaphors. ... I suggest that sociological thinking, like any other form of thought, cannot be achieved non-metaphorically. 21
Metaphor is used here in an inclusive figurative sense, to refer to the wide variety of modes of substitution of one figure into another; such a process suffuses language and meaning 21
Indeed to seek to establish non-metaphorical thought itself involves forms of metaphorical substitution.	 22
