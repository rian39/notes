While media and communication scholars have started to take notice of algorithms – writing about their power (Beer, 2013), relevance (Gillespie, 2014) and accountability (Diakopoulos, 2015) – little is yet known about the ways in which users know and perceive that algorithms are part of their ‘media life’ (Deuze, 2012). The focus of this article is thus on users’ understanding and experiences of algorithms in everyday life. In what situations do people become aware of algorithms? How do they experience and make sense of these algorithms, given their hidden and invisible nature? To what extent does an awareness of algorithms affect people’s use of these platforms, if at all? (31)

The aim is to help provide an understanding of the cultural imaginaries and ordinary affects of algorithms by developing the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. 31

The algorithmic imaginary is not to be understood as a false belief or fetish of sorts but, rather, as the way in which people imagine, perceive and experience algorithms and what these imaginations make possible.31

This implies that people do not necessarily need access to the precise instructions
that tell the computer what to do in order to experience an algorithm. As the opening sequence describing Jessa’s everyday encounter with an algorithm suggests, what people experience is not the mathematical recipe as such but, rather, the moods, affects and sensations that the algorithm helps to generate. 32
 
Where do you go to gather stories about things algorithmic? It turns out that one particularly useful place is the microblog- ging service Twitter. The public nature of Twitter, with millions of public profiles and text- using a platform-specific search engine, provides a great tool for accessing ideas, senti- ments and statements about almost anything, including algorithms. 33

During a nine-month period stretching from October 2014 to June 2015, I searched Twitter regularly for keywords and combinations of keywords, including: ‘Facebook algorithm’, ‘algorithm AND Facebook’, ‘algorithm AND weird’, ‘algorithm AND creepy’, ‘algorithm AND great’, etc. 33 

the personal algorithm stories shared as part of this study suggest that many of the participants are redesigning their expressions so as to be better recognised and distributed by Facebook’s news feed algorithm.37 

The Facebook algorithm seizes the social imaginary through the various affective encounters it generates. As the many different personal algorithm stories analysed in this article attest to, Facebook’s algorithms become part of ‘force-relations’ and are generative of different experiences, moods and sensations. The different scenes and situations can be understood as forming part of what might be called an algorithmic imaginary – ways of thinking about what algorithms are, what they should be, how they function and what these imaginations in turn make possible. 39-40

the ways in which algorithms are experienced and encountered as part of everyday life become part of ‘force relations’ that give people a ‘reason to react’. Affec- tive encounters between people and the Facebook algorithm are not just productive of different moods and sensations, but also play a generative role in moulding the algorithm itself. 41

To understand the spaces where people and algorithms meet, this article proposed the notion of the algorithmic imaginary. As algorithms are becoming a ubiquitous part of contemporary life, understanding the affective dimensions – of how it makes people feel – seems crucial. 42

Contrary to the notion that ‘the individual user is incapable of really experiencing the effect that algorithms have in determining one’s life as algorithms rarely, if ever, speak to the individual’ (Cheney- Lippold, 2011, p. 176), this article suggests that people do experience algorithms; and, while algorithms might not speak to individuals, they might speak through them. 42
