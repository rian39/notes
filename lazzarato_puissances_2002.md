Lazzarato, M. Puissances De L'invention : La Psychologie Économique De Gabriel Tarde Contre L'économie Politique. Paris: Empêcheurs de penser en rond, 2002.

introduction; multiplicity in economic phenomena
C'est par l'affectionabilité, par le sentir pur, fonds commun de désirs et de croyances, que Tarde décrit  la différence á la fois de nature et de degré entre les activités de creation et de reproduction. 21 

Chapter 1; cooperation between brains and the virtual
31 Action at a distance of minds - they imitate and invent
organism is a society, not the other way around 33
brain is a deterroritorialised body 35
brain co-operation precedes and exceeds creation of value in capital through division of labour 38
invention = cooperation, coproduction 39
invention which does not diffuse has no value 42
Pour Tarde la conversation, la publicité, la communications, la presse, l'opinion publique, l'imitation-mode et l'imitation-coutume, les villes et leur <<densité sociale>>, etc., contribuent à la diffusion-propagation des croyances et des désirs, des volontés et des intelligences. 43 

important passages on why publicity, media, conversation, press are not just about diffusion, but create new forms of invention 43-4. 

Imitation is the canvas from which new inventions arise. 44

Hence, the social, affective, cognitive and communicational is included in the production of value
Contrast b/w production and reproduction 47 - based on active and passive forces
Contrast b/w Marx’s account of the production of value and Tardes 49-50:  invention is difference that propagates according to the desires and beliefs that constitute it. 50 In diffusion, it opposes itself and adapts itself  to other inventions: hence the differentiation of difference 50. 
Can only explain the productivity of capitalism through the capture of the dynamics of brains, not div of lab 51
D&G’s version of Tarde: dx/dy of desires and affects produces invention 51-52


Chapter 2 opposition and sympathy
Chapter 3  subjectivity, action work
Chapter 4 wealth, knowledge, art
Impossible to oppose individual and society 129 because individual is a society  -  a multiplicity of relations;
So what is important is the passage and reversibility between two socieities 130 - the individual and the social are differential actualisations of the multiplicity of relations that constitute cooperation between brains. 131
*key point because it allows a critique of the individualism of GTD and at the same time, to situate its sociality.
Individual produces from below through infinitesimal belief and desires which imitate each other, combine and oppose - a multiplicity of imitative fluxes 132
*again, a key point, because it helps explain the webby side of GTD
Therefore think action as neither free or constrained but as coming from a singular interaction of forces in combination and imitation. 134
So not the sovereign individual, but a provisional achievenment constantly menaced by the play of forces that constitute it 137
The monster as the model of subjectivation 141: complicated passage, but interesting because it includes a co-ordinating, centralising force, and a desire to 'invade the world', and 
*key ethical question here: what is the alternative? What would an ethics that takes this into account look like?
C’est dans les métamorphoses et les variations de l’action de subjectivation et non les métamorphoese et les variations of valuer qu’il faut chercher la dynamique immanente du capitalisme 142
Look for metamorphoses and variations in the action of subjectification rather than of value that need to examine in order to find out about capitalism. 142
3 characteristics of action in Tarde – important for locative media stuff, 142-3: collaborative, inventive, virtual/potentialising; then the critique of Arendt and Ranciere on the basis of the inter-cerebral 144-5; especially to avoid containing the economic acritically 146

Ch 5 representation belief
211-212: imitation and invention as base of economic phenomena; all come from memory
215 desire and belief  are the bifurcation of pure feeling 
218 life as difference inserting itself into necessity; living being as a sum of virtualities
227 currents of imitation which meet, confront, repeat in the same manner between cells and between brains. In encoutering, these currents invent and constitute social quantities and values. The currents are attractive, associate forces provoking diverse arrangements. 
stuff on language 236-40 
*could use by analogy for technology
time as power of constitution, not measure 246
reduction of action to work - neutralises memory  247

Ch 6 invention, work, attention in cooperation
Principle of production in Tarde is memory, cooperation,  etc 250, not to an abstract notion of labour but to social labour, cooperation between brains. 
The whole spectrum from automatism to genius involves memory, but with different levels of intercalation. 251 cf Habermas or Arendt with their separations between work and action.. For Tarda a continuum between them. 
Labour as intermediate between routine and invention 255
Split between manual and mental labour is not useful 255 in distinguising reproduction and invention
Discussion of the entrepreneur 256-7 in Schumpeter, and then Tarde's critique of the division of labour - it invents nothing because it provides no joy of cooperation. 259
Shifts between sensory-motor and intellectual memory, towards virtual cooperation between brains 260
Description of intercerebral work as relational activity - how this is the economy itself 261
Intercerebral work produces beliefs, desires, made out of habits, opinions, etc 262; not limited to symbolic manipulation because it mobilises subrepresentative forces and time; rather it uses 'attention' and memory before it can work on ideas. 262-3
To capture or free attention - a key stake today 265
Important passage on distinction between living and dead labour, and how Tarde reconfigures it.  -  as living machine.  - there are automatisms in human and virtualities in the machine 265-6
Definitions of invention 268:  - coadaptation of imitative fluxes, a cooperation, even in an individual brain, but always a multitude of agents social and infinitesimal, and their ordinary ideas 270., 271 on the individual genius.as a mass of little consciousness 272
Invention as action as collaboration also suspends what is already individuated. 273 - puts inventor outside history, and into event.
Difference between diffusion in extension and diffusion intrinsic 274
Passage on control over imitation in Plato's republic 278-280
Imitation is memory itself - 281 - as habits in the body; as concepts, images, recollection in mind; 282: the largely uncs, preindividual, etc nature of these habits.
284 comparison to habitus which uses imitation passively - it cannot account for invention
293 the multiple man that Plato feared emerges in imitation-fashion world - free subjectivation and assujettissement result 294.
*useful for GTD
Sociality tends to differentiate and demultiply 294
chapter 7 property
Contra possessive individualism that only knows subjects and objects, relations are primary 321
Objects and subjects are only crossing points, relays, etc in the flux 321
Alienation thru buying and selling is less important, and replaced by access 323 – intercerebral cooperation
Chapter 8 politics of multiplicity
359 Another concept of biopower: life becomes a stake not because power makes it into an object, but because the powers of coproduction and cooperation which found life tend to enlarge.  Distinctions between work and leisure, between zoe and bios tend to erase under the action of cooperation between brains. 360
