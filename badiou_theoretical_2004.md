Multiplicity will be called  ‘closed’ when grasped by the numerical one, and ‘open’ when grasped by the vital One.  Every multiplicity is the joint effectuation of the closed and open, but its ‘veritable’ multiple-being lies on the side of the open. 72
Now, assigning the set to the closed, i.e. to numerical unity, reveals a limited concept of set. 72
For the set is the exemplary instance of something that is thinkable only if one dispenses entirely with the opposition between the closed and the open. ... We could even say that the set is that neutral-multiple which is originarily subtracted from both openness and closure, but which is also capable of sustaining their opposition. 73
A concept of the open is substantially established once we possess a multiple such that the we dwell within it by taking the intersection of two elements, or the union of many elements as we wish (even an infinity of elements). In the other words, the intersection of two opens is an open, and any union whatsoever of opens remains open. 73
the immanent excess that ‘animates’ a set, and which makes it such that the multiple is internally marked by the undecidable, results directly from the fact that it possesses not only elements, but also parts. 78
The statement according to which multiplicities have no parts already indifferentiates the two types of immanence, the two fundamental forms of being-in which set-theory separates when it distinguishes between (elementary) belonging and partitive (inclusion).  78
this excess is deducible from an internal non-cohesion between the two types of immanence 78
Every multiple is indeed actually haunted by an excess of power that nothing can give shape to, except for an always aleatory decision which is only given through its effects. 79
It is certainly the case that experience must, each and every time, re-determine this immanent excess.  79
There is an event only in so far as there exists a site for it within an effectively deployed situation (a  multiple). 101
Needless to say, a site is not just any fragment of an effective multiplicity. One could say there is a sort of 'fragility' peculiar to the site, which disposes it to be in some sense 'wrested' from the situation. This fragility can be formulated mathematically: the  elements of an evental site are such that none of their own elements belong to the site. 101
It is in fact clear that there are many cases where the elements of the elements of a multiple also belong to the given multiple. ... The liver is not an evental site. Inversely a cell can be considered as a site, because the molecules that compose it are not 'organic' in the same sense as the liver may be said to be organic. 101
The generic subset, we might say, contains a little bit of everything, so that no predicate ever collects together all its terms. The generic subset is subtracted from predication by excess. 110
Clearly, the act of the subject is essentially finite, as is the presentation of indiscernables in its being. Nevertheless, the verifying trajectory goes on, investing the situation through successive indifferences. Little by little, what takes shape behind these acts begins to delineate the contour of a subset of the situation – or of the universe wherein the evental axiom verifies its effect. This subset is clearly infinite and remains beyond the reach of its completion. Nevertheless, it is possible to state that if it is completed, it will ineluctably be a generic subset. 116
Since a truth is a generic subset of the universe, it does not let itself be summarized by any predicate, it is not constructed by an expression. 117
I will use the world 'situation' - the most anodyne word imaginable - to designate the multiple made up of circumstances, language, and objects, wherein some truth can be said to operate. 123-4
you certainly cannot straightforwardly name the elements of a generic subset, since the latter is at once incomplete in its infinite composition and subtracted from every predicate which would directly identify it in language. But you can maintain that is if  such and such an element will have been  in the supposedly complete generic subset,  then such and such a statement, rationally connectable to the element in question, is, or rather will have been, correct. Cohen describes this method – … – as that of forcing. 130. 
The state of the situation is the operation which, within the situation, codifies its parts or sub-sets. The state is a sort of metastructure that exercises the power of the count over all the sub-sets of the situation. Every situation has a state. Every situation is the presentation of itself, of what composes it, of what belongs to it. But it is also given as state of the situation, that is, as the internal configuration of its parts or sub-sets, and therefore as re-presentation. More specifically, the state of the situation re-presents collective situations, whilst in the collective situations themselves, singularities are not re-presented but presented. 157
There are always more parts than elements; i.e .the representative multiplicity is always of a higher power than the presentative multiplicity. This question is really that of power. 157
