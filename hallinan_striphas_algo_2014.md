But Netflix, and indeed the Netflix Prize, suggests more is at stake in this definition than which aspects of a people’s expressive life get to count as culture. What matters increasingly is the “universe of reference” implicit in this rubric (Guattari, 1995: 9), or the agency to which artifacts must appeal, as it were, to gain entry to culture. Until recently, one might reasonably surmise this agency was limited to human beings. Because people appeared to determine the worthiness of prospective cultural artifacts, more or less uniquely, it followed that culture’s universe of reference must be endogenous to the human species.13

As the public commentary on production decisions behind House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black suggest, expressive materials now find themselves addressing computers, too. These systems, and more importantly their algorithms, play a critical role in deciding which articles (or parts thereof) gain admission to the cultural realm, and in what form. Their doing so thus points in the direction of another universe of reference—a court of algorithmic appeal in which objects, ideas, and practices are heard, cross-examined, and judged independently, in part, of human beings.13
