Ross, Andrew,  Strange Weather: Culture, Science and Technology, Verso, 1991
No frame of technological inevitability has not already interacted with popular needs and desires; no introduction of machineries of control has not already been negotiated to some degree in the arena of popular consent. (98)
Far from being understood solely as the concrete hardware of sophisticated electronic objects, technology must be seen as a lived, interpretive practice for people in their everyday lives. To redefine the shape and form of that practice is to help create the need for new kinds of hardware and software (100)
If there is a challenge here for social critics, it might be the commitment to making our knowledge about technoculture into something like a hacker's knowledge, capable of penetrating existing systems of rationality that might otherwise be seen as infallible; a hacker's knowledge, capable of reskilling, and therefore of rewriting, the cultural programs and reprogramming the social values that make room for new technologies, capable of generating new popular romances around the alternative uses of human ingenuity. (100)
Technoliteracy, for us, is the challenge to make a historical opportunity out of a historical necessity (100)
