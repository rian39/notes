This means that in order to get a sense of orientation in the world and to protect ourselves from its dangers, we can not rely on those forms of thought, of reasoning, or of discourse which have their niche in one particular context or another. ... Everywhere, and in every situation, we speak/think in the same way, on the basis of logical-linguistic constructs which are as fundamental as they are broadly general. 36

The cognitive-linguistic habits of the species do not come to the forefront because someone decides to make them come to the forefront; they do so out necessity, or because they constitute a form of protection in a society devoid of substantial communities( or of “special places”). 42

Contemporary labor has introjected into itself many characteristics which originally marked the experience of politics. Poiesis has taken on numerous aspects of praxis. 50

However, in  a situation in which the means of production are not reducible to machines but consist of linguistic-cognitive competencies inseparable from living labor, it is legitimate to assume that a conspicuous part of the so-called “means of production” consists of techniques and communicative procedures. Now, where are these techniques and procedures created, if not in the culture industry? 1

When “subjective” cooperation becomes the primary productive force, labor activities display a marked linguistic-communicative quality, they entail the presence of the others. The monological feature of labor dies away: the relationship with others is a driving, basic element, not something accessory. Where labor move to the side  of the immediate productive process, instead of being one of its components, productive cooperation is a “publicly organized space. This “publicly organized space” - introjected into the labor process – mobilizes attitudes which are traditionally political. 63

The entire realm of productive forces is pre-individual. It is social cooperation in the form of action in concert, the totality of poietic, “political,” cognitive, emotional forces. It is the general intellect,  the general, objective, external intellect.  78

[T]he collective experience, the life of the group, is not, as we usually believe, the sphere within which the salient traits of a singular individual diminish or disappear; on the contrary, it is the terrain of a new and more radical individuation. By participating in a collective, the subject, far from surrendering the most unique individual traits, has the opportunity to individuate, at least in part, the share of pre-individual reality which all individuals carry within themselves. ... Only within the collective, certain not within the isolated subject, can perception, language and productive forces take on the shape of an individuated experience. 79

Since the term “pre-individual” must include sensory perception, language, and productive forces, we could also say that the “social  individual” is the individual who openly exhibits an ongoing ontogenesis, a unique development (with its own different layers or constituent elements). 80

Why is life, as such, managed and controlled? The answer is absolutely clear: because it acts as the substratum of a mere faculty, labor-power, which has taken on the consistency of a commodity. It is not a question, here, of the productivity of actual labor, but of the exchangeability of the potential to work. 83
The advanced technologies do not provoke a “displacement,” such as to dissipate a pre-existing “familiarity”; rather, they reduce to a professional profile  the experience of the most radical kind of displacement itself. 86
