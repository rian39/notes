My contention is that for generative critique we need a new story of realness, of how and where realness originates. 33
What made my relativist telling of the generalizing logic of Yoruba and English just another imperial prescription was my failure to recognize and respect this tripartite configuration of the world, knowers, and knowledge as a trope, as a working figure. 34
This is to picture knowing as routine and necessarily embodied collective acting emergent in the life of particular times and places, contingently linked both within those times and places and with other times and places. Adopting such a framing has me dealing with and telling stories of real worlds, where objects and subject materialize, or “clot,” in particular figured ways. As objects/subjects, they emerge and participate in real worlds as relational. More or less obdurate associations are mobilized in their participation in collective going-on. (Verran, 2001, 38).
This involves imagining a way of doing critique that effects neither the dominating unity of universalism nor the oppositional fragmentation of relativism. 36
A graphic numeration system and associated invention of zero is likely to arise in single-based numeration systems where mental calculation is difficult. 62
I suggest that what makes the difference is the languages that numerators and their clients speak. Words too are a material part of the activity of tallying. 67
[Z]ero seems to emerge with the pressures of the graphic recording of a clumsy calculating system. 64
In any practical going-on with numbers, what matters is that they can be made  to work, and making them work is  a politics. Yet is a politics that completely evades conventional foundationist analysis ... 88

I am suggesting that numbers are located in the embodied doing of rituals with hands, eyes, and words, but if this is so, how is it that they seem to have the capacity to be definitive even in the absence of any bodily doings? 101
Enumeration “transforms” all numerals to numbered bodies by the very precise operation of interpellating, and likewise transforms nonenumerated bodies to enumerated. 103
What I am suggesting is that there are multiple ways to do the relation unity/plurality; hence there are multiple sorts of numbers. 107
Every time such a congealed series is reenacted, the actions of other times and places are shifted down into this time and place. Enumerated entities are historical objects. 112
Encoding these practices of material ordering in a sequence of words is to develop a numeral system. A numeral system encodes the patterns made in the process of material ordering. 199
I am suggesting that science that gives a chance for doing a politics of difference mobilizes generalizing logic as transitional, as what transactions might be accomplished in 237
