French DNA : trouble in purgatory

A "happening in the world" is what needs to be understood. From time to time, and always in time, new forms emerge that catalyze previously existing actors, things, temporalities, or spatialities into a new mode of existence, a new assemblage, one that makes things work in a different manner and produces and instantiates new capacities. A form/event makes many other things more or less suddenly conceivable. 180

Events problematize classifications, practices, things. The problematization of classifications, practices, things is an event. A sensibility of constant change, and a certain pleasure and obligation to grasp it and participate in the transformations, constitute one mode of relating to things. This sensibility takes the mode of a keen awareness that the taken-for-granted can change, that new entities appear, that our practices of making are closely linked to those entities, that we name them, that we group them, that we experiment with them,  that we discover different contours when deploying questions and techniques.

The present is a good time to desist from employing totalizing categories like epoch, civilization, culture, and society (or, at the very least, hesitation, scrutiny, pausing, and pondering are in order before employing them). 181
