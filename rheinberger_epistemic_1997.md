- Rheinberger epistemic thing:
'They are material entities or processes -- -- that constitute the objects of inquiry. As epistmic objects, they present themselves in a characteristic, irreducible vagueness. 28
- technical objects:
'Through them ... the objects of investigation become entrenched and articulate themselves in a wider field of epistemic practices and material cultures, including instruments, inscription devices, model organisms, and the floating theorems or boundary concepts attached to them. 29
'The technical conditions determine the rleam of possible representations of an epistemic thing; and sufficiently stabilized epistemic things turn into the technical repertoire of the experimental arrangements. 29
