Proximity here is a requirement of the social obligations of everyday home and work life; something that actively needs to be worked at and is achieved through various forms of mobility. The relations that proximity names in this understanding accordingly refer to the maintenance and care of dispersed ‘pointillist’ relations. I have suggested that this understanding of proximity is informed by an ontology of connection, where proximity becomes a requirement in order to get something done, to maintain relations with significant near-dwellers. I have argued that this ontology of connection that characterises this form of proximity tethers everyday mobilities to very specific ways of orienting, knowing and dwelling on the move which is exemplified in the organisational logics of planning, coordination, synchronisation and calibration that is the focus of much mobilities research on ‘everyday mobilities’. As such, I have suggested that the line is an appropriate mobility diagram that captures these relations. In sum, this pointillist proximity is an active conceptualisation of proximity where proximity is an imperative that in turn gives rise to mobilities that allow proximity to be achieved: where proximity becomes the point of mobility. 

This is a more passive understanding of proximity. Here, proximity becomes an effect of mobility rather than an initial requirement. As an experiment in diagramming mobility, in the absence of an end point, the loop presents us with a figure through which we can consider how mobile bodies might not always be orientated by points. In removing the point, the productivist attractor, the loop brings other forms of receptivity to the forefront of analysis; receptivity to other, more transient near-dwellers that are encountered whilst on the move. I have suggested that these emergent and passive forms of proximity can be described as ‘transversal’ proximity which foregrounds an ontology of exposure to these other near-dwellers.

the loop as a movement-diagram is adept at thinking about the different receptivities towards and exposure to the near-dweller that is not an already-connected relation: an unanticipated neighbour. The loop is susceptible to all the interruptions and disruptions that are welcome rather than something to be overcome. However, imagining loops in their extensive, spatial form is only one part of the story. Whilst it might be easier to concentrate on loops in their ‘extensive’ form, as trajectories that are mappable topologically, there are other ways of imagining what looped mobility does in its intensive form; that is, a form that considers loops as much as a temporal formation – where loops can be grasped more through their duration and repetition – rather than just their spatial trace, and that is what I want to use the final part of this article to explore.
