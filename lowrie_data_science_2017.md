> Data science, by contrast, might be considered to be the collective development of algorithmic approaches to data handling. Rather than through logical proof and refutation, these algorithms are developed by their assembly within computational architectures and the social evaluation of their inputs and outputs with respect to some real-world set of tasks. Thus, this form of inquiry cannot function except as a by-product of the primary implementation of such assemblages in the real business of increasing the efficiency of certain types of these tasks. This is why efficiency has emerged as the operative logic of evaluation shared by my interlocutors working in both academic and industrial data science. Efficiency as a term is here chosen in part for its capacity and abstraction; what counts as efficiency depends largely upon the concrete problem space in which the data scientists is working at any given moment. As such, unlike proof and refuta- tion in mathematics, the discussions over efficiency that I witnessed frequently included stakeholders in the specific   domains   operated   upon   by   algorithmic [@Lowrie_2017,6]

>In short, algorithmic economy is an evaluative standard that, like much in data science, straddles ‘‘materiality, mathematics, and metaphysics’’ (Kockelman, 2013: 49). However, it is a standard immanent to the fact of being an algorithm, rather than one imposed post facto by the practical constraints of data science as a form of inquiry; this is the case to the exact extent (and no further) that ‘‘function’’ is immanent to the fact of being an organ rather than being a framework imposed by the physi- ologist or anatomist. 8
