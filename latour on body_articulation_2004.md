How to speak about the body article {Latour, 2004} uses James and Stengers to develop notion of
1. Articulation
2. Propositions
3. Interesting
4. Risky

———————————————————————-

Stengers and Despret’s general principle becomes: devise your inquiries so that they
maximize the recalcitrance of those you interrogate. 217

the more mediations the better. 219

Generalization
should be a vehicle for travelling through as many differences as possible
– thus maximizing articulations – and not a way of decreasing the number of
alternative versions of the same phenomena. 221

This eighth and last feature makes Stengers and Despret’s principle of sorting
out bad and good science an extraordinarily difficult, exacting and painful
requirement, because it forces scientists to take very seriously the outside of their
science as well as the conditions in which their results can be made compatible
or incompatible with those of the rest of the collective. 223

there is no primary quality, no scientist can
be reductionist, disciplines can only add to the world and almost never subtract
phenomena. 226

to abandon the distinction between subjective and objective bodies, secondary
and primary qualities, to deny to science the possibility of subtracting
phenomena from the world, to revere hospital institutions that allow one to be
affected, is not to abandon the difference between badly and well-articulated
propositions. On the contrary, it is to push the frontlines of the struggle inside
the sciences themselves, as Donna Haraway has always advocated. 227
