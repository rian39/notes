With the arrival of dense, continuous data and modern computation, we can now map out the details of society and build mathematical models of them. But these raw mathematical models are very far beyond most humans' understandings. They have too many variables and the relationships are too complex for the poor human mind. While these highly detailed and very mathematical models are good for building automatic systems for traffic, electric power,and the like, they are almost useless for guiding individual human decision making. 188-9

Today most people have little concept of how to use big data analytics, what they mean, and what to believe.
