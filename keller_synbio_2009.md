(Keller 2009)
Something curious that has happened to the term ‘synthetic’ in this division of labor between systems and synthetic biology: for the latter, the meaning of synthetic has become narrowed to that of physical reconstruction, leaving conceptual synthesis somewhere else, either to systems biology or off the board altogether. At first glance, this seems to do nothing more than place its own activities squarely in the realm of engineering. But in fact I think a more radical move is at work, for in much of synthetic biology today, the very link between analytic and synthetic is loosened here, and to the extent that that link is still present, it is far from clear that analytic comes first, either terminologically or methodologically.
