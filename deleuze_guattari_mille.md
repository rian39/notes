Writing now functions on the same level as the real, and the real materially writes. The diagram retains the most deterritorialized content and the most deterritorialized epxression, in order to conjugate them. 141
That trait is said to be " deterritorializing" in relation to the other precisely because it diagrams it, carries it off, raises it to its own power 142
Defined diagrammatically in this way, an abstract machine is neither an infrasturucture that is determining in the last instance nor a transcendental Idea that is determining in the last instance 142
The diagram knows only traits and cutting edges are still elements of content insofar as they are material and of expression insofar as they are functional 142
An axiomatization, a semiotization, a physicalization, is not a diagram but in fact the opposite of a diagram 142
