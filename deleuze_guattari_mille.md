On the contrary, a numerical sign that is not produced by something outside the system of marking it institutes, which marks a mobile and plural distribu- tion, which itself determines functions and relations, which arrives at arrangements rather than totals, distributions rather than collections, which operates more by breaks, transitions, migration, and accumulation than by combining unitsâ€”a sign of this kind would appear to belong to the semiotic of a nomad war machine directed against the State apparatus. The numbering number.8 Its numerical organization 139 

Writing now functions on the same level as the real, and the real materially writes. The diagram retains the most deterritorialized content and the most deterritorialized expression, in order to conjugate them. 141


That trait is said to be " deterritorializing" in relation to the other precisely because it diagrams it, carries it off, raises it to its own power 142

Defined diagrammatically in this way, an abstract machine is neither an infrasturucture that is determining in the last instance nor a transcendental Idea that is determining in the last instance 142

The diagram knows only traits and cutting edges are still elements of content insofar as they are material and of expression insofar as they are functional 142 {#diagram} {#edge}

An axiomatization, a semiotization, a physicalization, is not a diagram but in fact the opposite of a diagram 142 {#diagram}

Strata could never organize themselves if they did not harness diagrammatic matters or functions and formalize them from the standpoint of both expression and content. 144

to regain a plane of consistency that inserts itself into the most diverse systems of stratification and jumps from one to another, it suffices to prolong the lines of flight working the strata, to connect the dots, to conjugate the processes of deterritorialization. 145

diagrammatic: it consists in taking regimes of signs or forms of expression and extracting from them particles-signs that are no longer formalized but instead constitute unformed traits capable of combining with one another. This is the height of abstraction, but also the moment at which abstraction becomes real; everything operates through abstract-real machines (which have names and dates) 145-146

Pragmatics as a whole would consist in this: making a _tracing_ of the mixed semiotics, under the generative component; making the transformational _map_ of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creating, for budding along the lines fo thr tracings; making the _diagram_ of the abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities or as effective emergences; outlining the _program_ of the assemblages that distribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives, jumps and mutations 146-147.

Martial arts and state-of-the-art technologies have value only because they create the possibility of bringing together worker and warrior masses of a new type. The shared line of flight of the weapon and the tool: a pure possibility, a mutation. There arise subterranean, aerial, submarine technicians who belong more or less to the world order, but who involuntarily invent and amass virtual charges of knowledge and action that are usable by others, minute but easily acquired for new assemblages. 403
