predictive analytics are discoveries of micrological propensities that are not directly correlated with human understanding and affectivity and that do not by themselves cohere into clearly identifiable events [@Hansen_2015b, 111-112]

Whitehead’s concept can help us appreciate something fundamental about the prospective model of data mining and predictive analytics: its predictive power is a direct function of its broad grasp. Not only does prospective data mining always address a “total situation,” but it does so by analyzing data at a myriad of levels (or scales); it is only subsequently, as the result of an inductive process and as a function of probability, that such broad-ranging, microscalar analysis congeals into an identifiable macroscale phenomenon, an “event.” 108-9 

And what is qualified—­what actually comprises the threat—­is not the likelihood of a particular event, of a single actual cause, coming to pass, but a far more complex and diffuse calculus of propensities concerning a myriad of factors that can only be known insofar as they can be qualified probabilistically. It is these micro-­propensities, not the events they may go on to inform, that are the objects of probabilistic modeling.109

To the extent that this data—­“ data of sensibility” that are accessible only through technical means—­are in fact data about probabilities bearing on future occasions, they call for a fundamental shift in how we approach media: we must cease focusing on acts of discrete agents and seek to understand tendencies for situations to happen, tendencies that are informed by a wide swathe of (mostly) environmental data, all of which is gathered incrementally and molecularly.118 {#ensemble} {#platform-future}

Whatever explanatory and causal value predictive analytics of large datasets have is, I suggest, ultimately rooted in this ontological transformation whereby probabilities are understood to be expressions of the actual propensity of things [@Hansen_2015b, 120]  {#prediction} {#datasets} {#platform-positive}

This means, to put it slightly differently, that surrounding any delimited predictive system is a larger field of data—­what I elsewhere call a “surplus of sensibility”—­that, viewed speculatively, indexes the causal efficacy of the total situation within which this delimited system operates. (Effectively, the latter gains its reliability from closing off this larger surplus of sensibility, thereby transforming an always excessive propensity into a [provisionally] closed dataset.) Because it affords data that exceed whatever any given predictive system might include, the data of the world’s causal efficacy—­the data constituting its real potentiality—­always and in principle facilitates knowledge that cannot be restricted to any particular agenda. 126-7

Thus, as we seek to understand and to criticize the forms of predictive power that increasingly enframe—­and constrain—­our experience, it is imperative that we welcome—­on this score, in concert with the very predictive industries that are at issue here—­the technical interface to the data of sensibility making up the potential for our future experience. 126

## stuff on statistics
The force of the future—­the future force of every single datum in- forming the universe at a given moment—­is felt in the present in a way that can only be represented probabilistically and where such representation designates neither a purely abstract likelihood nor a statistical likelihood relative to a provisionally closed dataset, but a properly ontological likelihood: a propensity, which is to say, a likelihood that is, paradoxically, real. 120-121
