> predictive analytics are discoveries of micrological propensities that are not directly correlated with human understanding and affectivity and that do not by themselves cohere into clearly identifiable events [@Hansen_2015b, 111-112]

>Whatever explanatory and causal value predictive analytics of large datasets have is, I suggest, ultimately rooted in this onto­ logical transformation whereby probabilities are understood to be expressions of the actual propensity of things [@Hansen_2015b, 120] 

This means, to put it slightly differently, that surrounding any delimited predictive system is a larger field of data—­what I elsewhere call a “surplus of sensibility”—­that, viewed speculatively, indexes the causal efficacy of the total situation within which this delimited system operates. (Effectively, the latter gains its reliability from closing off this larger surplus of sensibility, thereby transforming an always excessive propensity into a [provisionally] closed dataset.) Because it affords data that exceed whatever any given predictive system might include, the data of the world’s causal efficacy—­the data constituting its real potentiality—­always and in principle facilitates knowledge that cannot be restricted to any particular agenda. 126-7

Thus, as we seek to understand and to criticize the forms of predictive power that increasingly enframe—­and constrain—­our experience, it is imperative that we welcome—­on this score, in concert with the very predictive industries that are at issue here—­the technical interface to the data of sensibility making up the potential for our future experience. 126
