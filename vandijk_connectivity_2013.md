Connectivity has become the material and metaphorical wiring of our culture, a culture in which technologies shape and are shaped not only by economic and legal frames, but also by users and content. A society rooted in norms of connectivity wields platforms that simultaneously construct and reflect the value of cultivating weak ties and of formalizing informal communication and self-expression – a complex and layered process that is constantly modulated.  142 {#platform-network} 

If connectivity were water, the change away from generativity towards tethered appliances represents the shift away from water running through public pipes and private taps towards drinking water delivered in larger and smaller bottles which  are rented and paid for – a service that is extremely convenient and user-friendly, but which also transfers considerable power to the companies handling and packaging the water. 143-144 {#platform-metaphor} {#infrastructure}

Three useful concepts to theorize the technological dimension of connectivity are platform, protocol and interface, precisely because these terms’ meanings carry beyond the technological realm into the social and the cultural. Platforms are usually either hardware, software or services (or combinations thereof) that help code social activities into formatted protocols and present these processes through user-friendly interfaces. 144 {#platform-definition} {#platform-metaphor}

Any platform’s connective structure is mediated by protocols: formal descriptions of digital message formats complemented by rules for regulating those messages in or between computing systems. On the one hand, protocols are technical sets of rules that ‘encapsulate information inside various wrappers, while remaining relatively indifferent to the content of information contained within’ (Galloway, 2004: 52); on the other hand, protocols gain their usability from how they are programmed and how they are governed or ‘managed’ by their owners (2004: 121).144 {#format}

Their logic, then, is determined through interfaces and by institutions – governmental, communal, or corporate – even if these sites appear to be operated by individual users or user communities. Protocols hide behind simple, user-friendly and often symbolic interface features; the complex technology or ‘internal interface’ is kept hidden from the user who can only see the front end or the ‘visible inter- face’. A visible interface has technical features (e.g. buttons, scroll bars, stars) and regulatory features (e.g. the rule that a personal profile is required before entering the site) that help steer connections between users and content 144 {#format}

The interest of platform owners to promise good connectivity ideally converges with the interest of users to generate and distribute (good) content. In reality, their interests also widely diverge. 149

We still know very little about the ‘codes’ underlying digitized processes of connectivity. Understandably, we tend to concentrate first on specific manifestations (platforms) or their specific aspects (users or content) or their political economy. The larger culture in which these platforms arise espouses a particular logic – a logic rooted in social needs and cultural norms – and supports technological systems striving to infiltrate practical social routines, so these routines become ensconced in economic models and legal schemes. Arguing from a combined actor-network and networked economy approach, Facebook is not a product, but a constantly evolving process whose changing manifestation is the result of a negotiation between owners, users, content producers, lawmakers, engineers and marketers about the control of data and technology. 152 {#ensemble} {#platform-definition}
