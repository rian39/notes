The platforms present themselves as self-evident—they just are. After all, they facilitate our feature-rich lives and everyone that counts is there. But before entering, everyone must first create an account, filling out a profile and choosing a username and password. Minutes later, you’re part of the game and start sharing, creating, playing, as if it had always been like that. The profile is the a-priori, a component that the profiling and targeted advertising cannot operate without. It is through the gateway of the profile that we become its subject. 27 {#subject} {#interface}

What particularly fails in this viewpoint is the notion of staging. Platforms are not stages; they bring together and synthesize (multimedia) data, yes, but what is missing here is the (curatorial) element of human labor. That is why there is no media in social media. The platforms operate because of their software—automated procedures, algorithms and filters—not through a large staff of editors and designers. Their lack of employees is their essence. It’s what makes current debates about racism, antisemi- tism and Jihadism on social media so futile. Forced by politicians, social media platforms are now employing armies of editors (“cleaners”) to do the all-too-human work of monitoring and moderating, filtering out supposedly ancient ideologies that have refused to disappear (more on 31

similar reference we find in Adam Greenfield’s Radical Technologies where he notices that “it seems strange to assert that anything as broad as a class of technologies might have an emotional tenor, but the internet of things does. That tenor is sadness... a melancholy that rolls off it in waves and sheets. The entire pretext on which it depends is a milieu of continuously shattered attention, of overloaded awareness, and of gaps between people just barely annealed with sensors, APIs and scripts.”a 46

Today sadness has become technical, a shift that applies equally to users and producers. Let’s first look at online video. Julia Alexander has documented the burnouts, panic attacks and other mental health issues of YouTube’s top creators. Alexander reports, “constant changes to the platform’s algorithm, unhealthy obsessions with remaining relevant in a rapidly growing field and social media pressures are making it almost impossible to continue creating at the pace both the platform and audience want.” 51 {#ambivalence}

In both daily and scholarly language, the terms of media, network and platform have become interchangeable. Whereas television, newspapers and smart phones are easily identifiable as distinct material carriers, social media blur all boundaries into one fuzzy online experience. To put it in today’s lingo: we share media on platforms through networks. 2 Each of the three concepts has been a grande idée that burst into the sphere of everyday language in a particular era. 61

As we speak, platforms are superseding both media and networks. Theo- rization of platforms is still in its infancy. If we want to write a genealogy of the platform, we could start off with an etymology of the Dutch platte vorm, the “flat form” as a level surface that operates as a gigantic equalizer of different forces and streams. 9 Rather than the lower surface of the polder, it’s important to note that the plateau is always situated on a higher level, following the ancient military strategy of positioning fortifications around churches, palaces and castles on hills in order to detect enemy movement. In the same way, platforms today harness informational dif- ferences and cannot easily be invaded. Platforms rule the surrounding territory, much as the Vauban fortresses once did. In principle they can be hacked and flooded, but in practice these disturbances are temporary (though the proviso here is that fully fledged cyber-warfare has not yet occurred). Alongside the fortification, platforms can also be compared with the city square, where markets were historically held. However, this metaphor should be stripped of any of the “natural” notions like supply and demand or the price equilibrium. Far from being natural, these envi- ronments are highly artificial—their economies invisibly manipulated by operators and “first movers” through algorithms and code. 67

Older technical definitions of platform may sound like this: “The entire hardware and software context in which a program runs. A program written in a platform-dependent language might break if you change any of the following: machine, operating system, libraries, compiler, or system configuration.” In this description, originating from the Perl pro- gramming community, we see the meaning of interdependency at work: take out one element and the system no longer works. Unfortunately, such tech definitions lack the necessary neo-liberal rhetoric. They would not survive the economic onslaught of the managerial consultancy. For business, the platform becomes a meta-product, a novel architecture for capitalization. US management gurus McAfee and Brynjolfsson, for example, sell platforms as a synthesis of social flows with a socio-economic intention. The duo defines platforms as “a digital environment with near-zero marginal cost of access, duplication, and distribution.” 12 In reality, platforms are Hegelian economic war machines that control the user experience. They aim to subordinate users, firms, and indeed anyone involved in the making of products, to its economic logic. “ 68

Backed by massive economic interests who will strive to keep these platforms afloat, we can only speculate that their demise will be different from the way platform pioneers such as Friendster, Hyves and Bebo turned into ghost towns overnight. What’s certain is their vulnerability when it comes to infor- mation complexity. So far, we only know a fraction about how platforms come into being; soon we will find out more about how they decline. 69


Bratton defines the stack as a combination of platforms. While stacks are platforms, most platforms are not stacks. Because of the facilitating nature of standards, platforms set the stage for the actions of others. What’s important in this context is Bratton’s description of platforms as a standardized diagram: no standards, no platform, no stack. In this way the platform can “tactically glue together lots of different things at different scales into more manageable and valuable forms.” 17 According to Bratton, “platforms pull things together into temporary higher-order aggrega- tions.” 18 He defines them as hybrids, organizational forms that are highly technical and feed on the indeterminacy of outcomes. As organizations, they can take on a powerful institutional role. Platforms resemble both markets and states without conforming completely to either. The result is a new form of sovereignty, a third institutional form. 72

4 How can we develop forms of protocological politics that aim at the core, yet operate with strong roots in daily lives, with strong ties in the localities that matter to us? Another key question for the next couple of years will be how we should relate to the platform-as-form. Finally, rather than diversion and fragmentation, the platform offers the possibility of synthesizing social energies and placing history making back into our own hands. The lure of platform power is definitely there. However, very few of us will be able to run a platform that is both successful and sustainable. The wish to centralize and scale up comes with a price. Who will we trust with this extraordinary responsibility? 75

Lists are not by definition useful—there is more to this topic than the shopping list or the to-do list. In his 1960 magnum opus Crowds and Power, Elias Canetti describes the various cultural techniques that rulers have used over the centuries to prevent a crowd turning into a dangerous, unpredictable mass. People are separated and placed one after the other, in a line. Following Canetti, we could say that lists are abstract lines, cues that wait to be processed. In contrast to the open crowd that swells and then suddenly disintegrates, the list is stable and fixed. Surprisingly few items can (and will be) taken on or off the list. The list is a symbol of hierarchy, power and stability. As a symbol for rational order, the list prevents the atomized subjects from unwanted articulations of collective energies. 89 

Why bother with the latest tweets and items on your Facebook Newsfeed if you can think through its underlying structures? This is a dialectic jump, shifting the debate away from the personal computer as a universal calculator and the smart phone as a communication coordi- nator and instead thinking about the broader digital machinery that is used to carry out work. How are we going to sabotage data centers? Is it sufficient to “zero day” attack them, or do they also need to literally be burnt down and destroyed? How can we democratize sophisticated info warfare hacker tools that are now only in the hands of a few intelligence services and specialist cyber security firms? 93

The first thing we need to do is organize the debate, inform ourselves about the multiple options of militant struggles against platform nihilism, and put all the options on the table. 97

Can we still talk about the narcissistic personality in the selfie context, as if it were an individualistic trade? Not really. The selfie is first and foremost a technological gesture, produced by a specific hardware condition (a smartphone with a built-in camera, always-on cell reception, selfie sticks), threading through photography software and dispositions of being. Part of the documenting of “the now” is the minimal lag between photo taken and photo circulating on platforms such as Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. We cannot talk about the selfie, therefore, and remain silent about the invisible Like-economy behind itnarcissus confirmed: technologies of the minimal selfie . 107 all, the billion dollar advertising industry, the ubiquity of facial recogni- tion software and the burgeoning surveillance market of people’s private data. We’ve learned to accept that the selfie is quantified, the smile is commodified, and the resulting value is traded behind the user’s back. 106-107

Operating inside the contexts of technology, media activism and internet politics, the commons is finally turning into a hotly debated topic outside of theory and activist circles. Code is shaping our world, and its architecture is voluntary and plastic. However, written by geeks and engineers, this code is anything but God-given, let alone neutral. Where do the underlying ideas come from and how are we going to accelerate the transition? Who’s taking the lead? 139
