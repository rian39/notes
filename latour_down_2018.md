tell us a little about where you'd like to land and with whom  you agree to share a dwelling place


wave of populism, migration crisis, growth of inequalities: 'three different responses, basically comprehensible if not effecit, to the powerful reaction of the Earth to what gloabalization has done to it. 20-21

Terrestrial with a capital T to emphasize that we are referring to a concept, and even specifying in advance where we are headed: the Terrestrial as a new *political actor.* 40

How are we to act if the territory begins to participate in history, to fight back, in short, to concern itself with us 41

we are no longer dealing with small fluctuations in the climate, but rather with an upheaval that is mobilzing the earth system itself 43

every material object has taken on its own "ecological dimensions" 45

there is nothing innovative, nothing more present, subtle, technical and artificial (in the positive sense of the words), nothing less rustic and rural, nothing more creative, nothing more contemporary than to negotiate landing on some ground. 53 

no progress will be made towards a 'politics of nature' as long as the same term is used to designate, for example, research in to terrestrial magnetisim, the classification of the 3.500 exoplanets that have been spotted to data, the detection of gravitational waves, the role of earthworms in soil areation, the reaction of shepherds in the Pyrenees to the reintroduction of bears, or the reaction of bacteria in our intestines to our latest gastronomic overindulgence. That nature is a real catch-all. 73

Redirecting attention from "nature" toward the Terrestrial might pt an end to the disconnect that has frozen political positions since the appearance of the climate threat and has imperiled the linking of the so-called social struggles with those we ecological. 82

Terrestrials in fact have the very delicate problem of discovering how many *other beings* they need in order to subsist. It is by making this list that they sketch out their *dwelling places* 87

The soil allows us to attach ourselves; the world allows detachment 93

Each of the beings that participate in the composition of a dwelling place has *its own way( of identifying what is local and what is global, and of defining its entanglements with the others. 93

what to do? first of all, *generate alternative descriptions.* How could we act politically without having inventoried, surveyed, measured, centimeter by centimeter, being by being, person by person, the stuff that makes up the Earth for us? 94
