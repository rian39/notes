Lawrence Busch: Performing the economy, performing science 451

Idea here is that SCM has a different role for technology — 
It does so at the cost of turning everything into commodities # into undifferentiated products that compete with each other solely on price.

In contrast, in SCM models technology is treated strategically and in a
much more nuanced manner. The treadmill is considered quite negatively to
the extent that it affects a particular supply chain actor. As General Electric
Chief Executive Jeffrey R. Immelt put it, ‘Managing innovation better may be
the only way out of the ‘‘abyss called commodity hell’’’ (quoted in Hof 2004:
129). For Immelt and other proponents of SCM, innovation is accorded a
special place as a means of differentiating product A from product B. That
differentiation is in part accomplished through stronger intellectual property
rights as well as steeper learning curves, so as to slow the treadmill and shift
competition to something other than price. 451-2

Hence, government policies of all sorts, technoscientific change, qualification of goods, persons, firms, standards, NGOs, the active shaping of consumer preferences, and in principle an endless range of other actors, can be the subject of SCM analysis. 460
