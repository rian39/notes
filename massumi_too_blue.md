The event lies at the intersection of at least two (and in reality many more)
process lines. One is the adoption and imposition by the experimenter of the
institutional set-up of the experiment, as defined linguistically, architecturally,
and on any number of other interlocking levels. Call this the context. Context
pre-exists. The possibility of maintaining objectivity in the face of surprise comes
from the context’s relative stability as a more or less determinate given. The
second process line is the self-insistence of an autonomy of experience. Reserve
the term situation for the event of an autonomy of experience pushing into and
moving across a context. 181



As it transpires, the excess of blue is owned by the experimentee only retrospectively. It makes ingress in
excess of its expressibility as a personal feeling. The ‘excess’, then, is less the
quantity of feeling than the surprising manner in which the feeling preceded itself
into the context: it is the contextual precession of ownable feeling. That is why the
‘excess’ is not simply a quantity of feeling, however great. It is a qualitative surplus
over any quantity of per sonal feeling. It may well not have come about without
an antecedent accumulation of familiarity and fondness. But it is not reducible to
that personal ‘investment’. (185)

Call the openness of an interaction to being affected by something new in a
way that qualitatively changes its dynamic nature relationality. Relationality is a
global excess of belonging-together enabled by but not reducible to the bare fact
of having objectively come-together. Relationality cannot be accounted for by the
objective proper ties of the actual ingredients in play considered as discrete elements.
It cannot even be reduced to the interactions that might logically be predicted
according to those proper ties. (191)

Relationality is the potential for singular effects of qualitative change
to occur in excess over or as a supplement to objective interactions. Relationality
pertains to the openness of the interaction, rather than to the interaction per
se or to its discrete ingredients. (191)

The birth of a new technical object is never a linear progress. It is knotty, a
mangle-prone emergence across a threshold of surprise. A new cycle begins, from
active indeterminacy, to vague determination, to ‘full’ determination (nominal
identity deployed within a conventional sphere of practical dependability). The
life of a technical object must always pass through the stages of ultimate fact of
experience (rupture/irruption/threshold of existence) and merely-talked-about
factoid (semi-objective elaboration) before finally baring itself through experimentation
(verification/profitable deployment). 183

Reserve the term ‘emotion’ for the personalized content, and affect for the
continuation. Emotion is contextual. Affect is situational: eventfully ingressive to
context. Serially so: affect is transsituational. As processional as it is precessional,
affect inhabits the passage. It is pre-and post-contextual, pre-and post-personal,
an excess of continuity invested only in the ongoing: its own. Self-continuity
across the gaps. Imper sonal affect is the connecting thread of experience. (185)

Discursive and institutional practices manage a certain regularity and predictability
in the passage from context to context. This contextual continuity is
in a different mode from the affective. It pertains to nominal identity. Identified
subjects and objects are considered, in principle, to cross the affective gap
between contexts essentially unchanged. It is admitted that they appear in the successive contexts in which they figure under continual modification, but the change
is understood as occur ring within acceptable bounds of recognizability and predictability.
This gives their progress the appearance of an ordered, even necessary,
evolution (or history ). (186)

Every event, of whatever kind, carries conditions of anomaly. There is always a really-perceived miss in every context. There is always something really amiss in contextualized language use. No anomaly, no thisness: it’s as simple as that. The necessary ‘more’ than objective ingredience is never subjective in the narrow, personalized sense, even when it
has to do with emotion. Emotion was able to make the difference (between particular
ity and singularity) because it made ingress: because it was operating
transsituationally, in the gap between its entering the exper imental context and
its leaving the contexts of previous fr iendship. It effectively interfered and modulated
because it was operating pre-expressively, in the affective manner in which
it precedes itself. It had proceeded to phase back into affect. (190)

A potential does not pre-exist its emergence. If it doesn’t emerge, it’s because it wasn’t really there. If it does, it really only just arrived. Potential is an advent. It is the contingency of an event in the future imperfect: ‘will have’ (precessive processing). It just will have come, that’s all there is to it. Always, just: a hint of eternity arriving. Before coming, it will have been objectively indeterminate. Really. Not a calculable co-presence of already-possibilities: a virtuality.16 The virtual is not quantifiable. Quasicausality expresses a real, material reser ve of unpredictable potential; a vir tual ‘always just will have’ in excess of the possible; a non-objecti. able kernel or qualitative remainder of self-producing impossibility in matter, anomalously apt to irrupt in even the most closely controlled contexts. Surprise. Matter boost. In effect, uncaused. Selfcreative activity in and of the world. (192)

Taking into account the quasicausality or relational causality contingently
necessary to self-organization involves a willingness to find in matter itself the
incipiency of distinctions more comfortably restr icted to the human cultural
level: liveliness, context/situation, quantitative/qualitative, subject/object (creative/
reactive), sensation/affect (global openness to change). Most especially the
latter. (193)
