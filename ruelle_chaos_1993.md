Ruelle, David. 1993. Chance and chaos. London: Penguin
One of the most pervasive ideas in mathematics is that of geometrization. This means, basically, visualization of all kinds of things as points of a space. 57
The physics of chaos, however, in spite of frequent triumphant announcements of “novel” breakthroughs, has had a declining output of interesting discoveries. 72
Furthermore, in many cases (ecology, economics, social sciences) the basic equations of evolution, whatever they are, slowly change with time (the system “learns”). For such systems, then, the impact of chaos remains for the time being at the level of scientific philosophy rather than quantitative science. 79
