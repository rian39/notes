Borden, Iain. 2004. A Performative Critique of the City: the Urban Practice of Skateboarding, 1958-98. In The city cultures reader, 2nd Edition, edited by I. Borden, T. Hall and M. Miles. London: Routledge.
Here in the movement of the body across urban space, and in its direct interaction with the modern architecture of the city, lies the central critique of skateboarding - a rejection both of the values and of the spatio-temporal modes of living in the contemporary capitalist city. 292
When skateboarders ride along a wall, over a fire hydrant or up a building, they are entirely indifferent to its function or ideological content. They are therefore no longer even concerned with its presence as a building,as a composition of spaces and materials logically disposed to create a coherent urban entity. 293
