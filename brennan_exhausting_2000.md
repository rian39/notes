all beings, all entities in and of the natural worlds, all forces, whether naturally or artificially forged, are connected energetically. 41
One can have an inherent order of connection which is not linear; this is the order found in nature's logic which perpetuates the living: a logic of multitudinous paths that intersect, that works through living things rather than imposing itself upon them from outside and above. 49
technological shifts have energetic effects on us, and this might help explain why we theorize energy and boundaries in different ways at different times. 51
Our ideas about energy, our psychical boundaries, reflect, or to use a more accurate term, literally embody the specific energetic continuums we inhabit. 51
the inertia constructed by money and the dead world of commodities both induces and reinforces the foundational fantasy within, and … the desires generated in this way feed the fantasy without. 52
energy in human bodies is constrained by a kind of overlay, a rigid map of pathways that parallels nothing so much as the overlay of bitumen roads that binds the earth. 55
By understanding these fixed points we will be able to see, or being to see, how the psychical experience of the foundational fantasy, and its historical, macrocosmic enactment are linked. 55
What prompts the hallucination is the desire that the longed-for object be present here and now. 56

the primary process consists of the pathways in which energy is bound in familiar patterns 57
if one looks closely at what the initial repression of hallucination involves (…), it is evident that something is happening to energy in the process, and also that 'time' is measured relative to something other than the constructed space-time of which it is also part. 59

The attention or attentive energy received from another means that the subject-to-be is able to deal with a problem that would be difficult for it to resolve if it existed in a self-contained energetic system. 65

Energetic substance is manifest in anything from motion to the intermediate experience of affects: affects are especially important as a category in which some of the original indissolubility of thought and substance are retained: they keep the tie to matter, as emotions are indubitably corporeal, at the same time as they reflect ideational responses: we can regard them as the slower-motion residues of the original connection between thought and substance. 67
The energy bound in commodities is that of living nature. 68
Like the hallucination, the commodity provides a point of resistance, in that it encapsulates living nature in forms which are removed from the flow of life. It functions analogously with hallucinations in that it makes living substances inert relative to the energetic movement of life. We can assume that the more of these relatively inert points there are, the slower the movement of life becomes. 68
this slow movement underpins a different sense of time, one that appears faster, but is in fact slower, than that of life. 69 
In a market system, a commodity is always produced for exchange, and has exchange-value. But it also and always has use-value, and there can be no use-value without nature, or natural substance.  … But if nature or certain natural forces are shown to have an energetic property in common with labour-power, the 'essential contradiction' has more explanatory power. Natural is the source of all value, and ultimately of all energy, but the inherent dynamic of capital is to diminish this value and this energy in favour of time and technology. 76
various natural forces are potentially identical to labour-power in their capacity for adding energy 81
it is the livingness or energy of labour-power that is critical in its ability to add value, and which seems to make it unique amongst the other commodities entering production 83
labour adds value to the product in two senses. First, labour adds exchange-value to the product because of the difference between labour and labour-power: it is the only subjective factor in the production process. …. Second, labour adds value to the product not only because it contributes more than it costs, but because this value is materialized in the product. 83
the more readily consumable, the higher the use-value 85
means of production – instruments + material (nature); fixed = machines, buildings; circulating – energy + raw material; labour = variable capital; 
the assumption that labour alone is living, and that nature is not, is entirely consistent with the omnipotent foundational fantasy. 94
As labour-power is precisely energy, even 'tension', it has everything in common with other natural forces, capable of realizing energy as humans can.  … Like labour-power, natural sources and forces are commodities capable of releasing and adding energy. Like labour-power, they have a certain time of natural reproduction, which means that, potentially, the value they add in production can be greater than their reproduction time. 94
all natural sources of energy entering production should be treated as variable capital and sources of surplus-value, and some can be replaced by others. 95
there is no real check on the speed with which variable capital can be used up, apart from whether or not a particular form of variable capital can be replaced, meaning its reproduction has to be guaranteed. 95
the range and speed of circulation is one key to how surplus-value is extracted and profits made. 96
the process by which one energy source will be replaced by another can be formulated in terms of what I call a law of substitution. 96
In certain circumstances, and from its peculiarly ruthless perspective, capital might be concerned for the reproduction of natural forces, and the substances on which they depend 98
If production can continue through the availability of other natural forces and entities whose reproduction can be disregarded, it is the availability, not the reproduction, that matters 105
The measures of availability and reproduction have to be incompatible in the short term in that capital is also and always governed by time. 106
Reproduction time, as the real measure of value, intersects with the speed of acquisition to the extent that capital has to take account of the reproduction of raw labour-power and … of the reproduction of other natural forces. 107
The speed of acquisition … is the difference between  the cost of acquiring raw materials or commodities for production at a certain speed, and the energy they add in production that gives rise to surplus-value. 
speed and substance represent two competing dynamics in any order dominated by capital. Capital will live or die according to the speed of acquisition, but to live by the speed of acquisition is to live under a fantasmatic law. 109
But use-valeu has a quantitative dimension, to which we have already alluded in terms of a continuum of substance and energy. It is quantifiable to the extent that nature overall is quantifiable.  110
Two types of 'transformation' can now be distinguished: that which diminishes and objectifies, and that which does not. This takes us directly to the overall quantitative dimension of use-value and substance. 112
under capitalism, consumption bears no relation to production, except in its own terms, and these must diminish the quantity of use-vale overall to the extent that speed is capital's imperative. 115
as far as the long term is concerned, as the overall quantity of substance of use-vale is diminished, so must the overall quantity of potential surplus-value, and hence profit be diminished 116. 
exploitation always involves an energetic transfer. In fact we can define exploitation on this basis: where there is no energetic transfer that depletes one agency while enriching the other, there is no exploitation. 185
