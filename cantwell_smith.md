The Origin of Objects

Fundamental to the view is a claim that objects, properties, practice, and politics-indeed everything ontological-live in what is called the middle distance: an intermediate realm between a proximal though ultimately ineffable connection, reminiscent of the familiar physical bumping and shoving of the world, and a more remote disconnection, a form of unbridgeable separation that lies at the root of abstraction and of the partial (and painful) subject-object divide. No sense attends to the idea of complete connection or complete disconnection; limit idealizations are outmoded. 3

Early on I said that objects are things on which one can have a perspective. 295

Once the proper metaphysical picture is introduced, the same insight gives rise to two conclusions: not only are no objects entirely physical; none are entirely local, either. Nothing is what it is solely in virtue of what inheres in it, since to be an object is in part to be registerable as that object, and registration requires separation and distance. 363

It followed that material objects-and the material world more generally-occupy what we might call a middle ground, half-day between (the predecessor era's notion of) the physical world, and (the predecessor era's notion of) the intentional world. 363
