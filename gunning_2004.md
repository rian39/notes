I am positing a phenomenological fascination with photography that involves a con-
tinuing sense of the relation between the photograph and a pre-existing reality. While this is precisely what “indexicality” supposedly involves, I am less and less sure this semiotic term provides the proper term for the experience. 45

I am not sure that the indexical explanation fully accounts for our fascination with the photographic image, its sense of perceptual richness and nearly infinite detail that strikes us as somehow more direct than other forms of representation. 45

I would rather emphasize the sense of a nearly inexhaustible visual richness to the
photograph, combined with a sense of the photograph’s lack of selection. 47
