Castells, Manuel , Mireia  Fernandez-Ardevol, Jack  Linchuan-Qiu, and Araba  Sey, eds. Mobile Communication and Society. A Global Perspective: MIT Press, 2005.

What we intend to do in this book is to construct an empirically grounded argument on the social logic embedded in wireless communication, and on the shaping of this logic by users and uses in various cultural and institutional contexts – an argument whose analytical value should stand by itself. 4
Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the technology is diffusing and attracting attention from people who find it interesting and potentially significant. However, the extent of actual Wi-Fi usage is lower than expected. 28
Because the network grows incrementally with every new access point and every device capable of receiving Wi-Fi signals, there is no need for incentives to convince a monopoly provider to build expensive infrastructure. 102
The key feature in the practice of mobile communication is connectivity rather than mobility. This is because, increasingly, mobile communication takes place from stable locations, such as the home, work, or school. ... [M]obile communication is better defined by its capacity for ubiquitous and permanent connectivity rather than by its potential mobility. 248
Wireless communication technologies diffuse the networking logic of social organization  and social practice everywhere, to all contexts – on the condition of being on the mobile Net. 258
