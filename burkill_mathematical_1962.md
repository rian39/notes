A distinguishing feature of the calculus is that it rests on limiting processes. The gradient of a curve at a point $P$ is the _limit_ of the slope of a chord $PQ$ as $Q$ approaches $P$ along the curve. In symbols, if the equation of the curve is $y=f(x)$, then the gradient is the derivative, $dy/dx$ or $y=f'(x)$, defined by
$$f'(x) = lim{h->0} {f(x+h) - f(x)}/h$$
The integral calculus also rests on the notion of the limit. A basic problem of it is the calculation of an area bounded by a curved line. The only way in which an area can be evolved from the areas defined in geometry is as the limit of the ares of polygons which approach the curve. 1

The notion of a limit rests on that of a _function_. The curve of which we were finding the gradient was specified by the function $f(x)$. The sume $s_n$ of the first $n$ terms of the geometric progression  is expressed as a function of $n$ of the geometric progression is expressed as a function of $n$ by 
$$s_n = 1-2^{-n}$$

The idea of a function in its turn rests o that of _number_. The equation $y=f(x)$ of the curve expresses a connection between the number $x$ and the number $y$. 2

In a general field there is no relation of order by which we can say that, of any two elements, one precedes the other. 12

Let $u_n$ be defined for all positive integral values of $n$. Define
$$ s_n = u_1 + u_2 + ... + u_n $$
or, more shortly, $s_n = \sum_{r=1}^{n} u_r.$. 
If, as $n ->\infinity$, $s_n$ tends to a finite limit $s$, we say that the infinite series
$$u_1 + u_2 + u_3 + ... $$
or $\sum_{n=1}^{\infinity}$ converges (or _is convergent_), and that $s$ is its sum. 38

Commonly the step from the experimental data or the hypotheses to the conclusions that they can be made to yield lies in solving _differential equations._ Relations are given connecting an unknown function with its first or second (or higher) derivates, and the function has to be found. The analyst is led to keep a stock of such functions as occur repeatedly. 104

The exponential function

Define
$$exp x = 1 + x + x^2/factorial(2) + ... x^n/factorial(n) + ...$$


There are close analogues between the convergence properties of infinite series and those of infinite integrals. 140
