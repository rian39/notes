Latour, parts, wholes 2012

‘let the agents produce a dynamics and collect the traces that their actions leave as they unfold so as to produce a rich data set’{Latour et al, 2012}. It would ask: ‘is it possible to do justice to … common experience by shifting from prediction and simulation to description and data mining?’ 13


To be part of a whole is no longer to ‘enter into’ a higher entity or to ‘obey’ a dispatcher (no matter if this  dispatcher is a corporate body, a sui generis society, or an emergent structure), but 
for any given monad it is to lend part of itself to other monads without either of 
them losing their multiple identities. 14

Another experience of 'being in a whole' should be explored that has little to do with 'being a part' of a 'structure' no matter if this structure is a sui generis super-organism or an emerging level. 11

 In 2-LS social theory, the most current 
approach to handling the distinction between macro-structures and micro- 
interactions consists in establishing a first level of individual entities, then adding 
to them a few rules of interaction, in order to observe whether the dynamics of 
interaction lead to a second level, that of aggregation, which has generated enough 
new properties to deserve to be called a ‘structure’, that is, another entity for which 
it is possible to say that ‘it is more than the sum of its parts’. Such is the way in 
which most models of collective behaviour are framed, no matter if they deal with 
atoms, gas, molecules, insects, swarms, markets, crowds, States, artificial lives, etc. 
.... 
It is important to underline here that since the 17th century this paradigm has been 
set in opposition to its apparent alternative that starts with a sui generis entity 
—for instance a body, an organ, a superorganism, an anthill, a beehive, a society, 
a State, etc.— in order, then, to define its individual ‘parts’ as endowed with ‘roles’ 
and ‘functions’. Such an alternative is often called ‘holistic’ or ‘organicist’ (Weick, 
1995). 6
