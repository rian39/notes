Diffie's breakthrough itself involved something that, in the context of the history of cryptography, seemed an absolute heresy: a public key. Until that point, there was a set of seemingly inviolable rules when it came to encryption, a virtual dogma that one ignored at the risk of consignment to crypto hell. One of those was that the same key that scrambled a message would also be the instrument that descrambled it. This is why keys were referred to as symmetrical. (69)
