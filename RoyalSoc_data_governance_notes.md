Fascinating new forms of data analysis such as machine learning have vastly
increased the ability to link this data and use the patterns that emerge. As data
collection activities continue to increase in speed, scale and variety, and the
analytic techniques used to process these datasets become more sophisticated,
individuals and communities are affected in new and unexpected ways. 5

The ease of collecting and managing large volumes of data in
‘big data’ platforms and the availability of new tools to analyse such data – such
as machine learning 13 – means that large volumes of data can be collected,
integrated and analysed in ways that generate unexpected patterns or insights
which go far beyond the original intended purpose of data collection. 18

A dialogue exercise undertaken as part of the Royal Society’s work on machine
learning considered the ability for machine learning to personalise options. There
was concern among participants that this personalisation might, in some cases,
restrict their freedom of choice. Conversely, participants also considered that
machine learning would help improve their experiences in some circumstances.45 

The Royal Society’s report _Machine Learning: The Power and Promise of
Computers that Learn by Example_ sets out why it is not appropriate to set up
governance structures for machine learning per se. While there may be specific
questions about the use of machine learning in specific circumstances, these
should be handled in a sector-specific way, rather than via an overarching
framework for all uses of machine learning. Some sectors may have existing
regulatory mechanisms that can manage, while others may not have
these systems. 48

Because many types of data – or technologies making use
of data – have significant or contested social values embedded within them,
such a stewardship body would need strong capacities for public engagement,
deliberation and debate. We see this body as an essential step in stewarding the
landscape during the period of particularly disruptive transition which society faces
for the coming years. 49
