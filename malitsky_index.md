Second, a more comprehensive notion of Peircean semiotics that accounts for the index as trace and as deixis challenges the exclusion of animation by allowing us to mark certain animation strategies as insisting on ‘co-presence’, or ‘thereness’, or even on ‘nowness’ and therefore partaking of the indexical logic. At the same time, it encourages the identification of animation strategies that work to distinguish the animated material from the natural world, directing its meaningfulness toward other dimensions. 248

Rather, it opens the door to a new conception of realism that accounts for the perceptive criticisms and yet offers new possibilities for connection between all actants in the natural and historical world. 250

The work by Rosen and others to transform the terms of Bazin’s realist aesthetics and ontology, 12 along with alternative conceptions of realism in science studies, have the potential to inform new conceptions of documentary realism and, in turn, to reconfigure the

This conception of a realism shorn of naiveté and committed to establishing connections resonates with an actor-network theory notion of realism. 13 A version of realism informed by actor-network theory embraces relativism, seeking to articulate the relations between actants in the world. It is a process of making these connections visible, sensible, knowable, and immediate without denying that the constructive process takes place. It recognizes the connections between things as an experience of a relation, an encounter between people, filmmaker and objects, between viewer, sounds, and images. In that way, realism perhaps relies on a tacking back and forth between proximities, pushing things away to bring them closer. 251-252
