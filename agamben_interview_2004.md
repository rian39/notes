This is, at bottom, what I like so much about Simondon: he always thinks individuation as the coexistence of an individual, personal principle and an impersonal, nonindividual principle.12 In other words, a life is always made up of two phases at the same time, personal and impersonal. They are always in relation, even if they are clearly separated. The order of impersonal power that every life relates to could be called the impersonal, whereas desubjectivation would be this daily experience of brushing up against an impersonal power, something both surpassing us and giving us life. That, it seems to me, is what the question of the art of living would be: how to relate to this impersonal power? How can the subject relate to this power that doesn’t belong to it, and which surpasses it? 124
