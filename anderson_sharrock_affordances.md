Objects, processes and actions are set against one another in that they emerge from or retreat to a background. The environment is structured so that feeling, hearing and seeing is possible. But, of course, this structure is not unique to us. It is available in patterned or institutionalised ways; ways, that is, which we share with others. In that sense, the possibility of perception can be said to be culturally provided. 146
