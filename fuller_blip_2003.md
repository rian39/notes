These blips, these events in software, these processes and regimes that data is subject to and manufactured by, provide flashpoints at which these interrelations, collaborations, and conflicts can be picked out and analysed for their valences of power, for their manifold capacities of control and production, disturbance and invention. It is the assertion of speculative software that the enormous spread of economies, systems of representation, of distribution, hiding, showing, and influence as they mesh with other systems of circulation, of life, ecology, resources – themselves always both escaping and compelling electronic and digital manifestation – can be intercepted, mapped, and reconfigured precisely by means of these blips (30-31).
What are these blips? They are interpretative and reductive operations carried out on live processes. They are the statistical residues of dynamics of association, escape, misery, acquiescence, and delight. They are not merely signifiers of an event, but integral parts of it. The figures in a bank balance, the links appearing in a web browser, are concrete arrangements, formations that determine relative degrees of potential movements within a specified level of analysis or use of a system. They have an implicit politics.31
