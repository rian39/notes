Political 'thought' is a numerical exegesis 2

Number governs the quasi-totality of the 'human sciences ... Statistics invades the entire domains of these disciplines. The bureaucratisation of knowledges is above all an infinite excrescence of numbering. 2

At the beginning of the twentieth century, sociology unveiled its proper dignity -- its audacity, even -- in the will to submit the communitarian bonds to number. It sought to extend to the social body and representation the Galilean processes of literalisation and mathematisation. But ultimately it succumbed to an anarchic development of this enterprise. 2

It is in its very essence that the cultural fabric is woven by number alone. 3

Number informs our souls. 3

establishing a thinking of number that, by fixing the latter's status as a form of the thinking of Being, can free us from it sufficiently for an event, always trans-numeric, to summon us, whether this event be political, artistic, scientific or amorous. Limiting the glory of number to the important, but not exclusive, glory of Being, and thereby demonstrating that what proceeds from an event in terms of truth-fidelity can never be, has never been, _counted_. 9

what, among the possible objects of thought, singularises those which fall under the concept of number.23

Essentially, a Number is a fragment sectioned from a natural multiplicity; a multiplicity thought, as ordinal, in tis being qua being. 211

Every attempt to reduce the matheme to the sole spatialised evidence of a syntax of signs runs aground on the obscure prodigality of being in the forms of the multiple. 51

Number is neither that which counts, nor that which we count. This regime of numericality organises the forgetting of number. 51

Number is that which through being _organises_ thought. 92
