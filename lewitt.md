the idea of concept is the most important part of the work. ... The idea becomes a machine that makes the art' (Lewitt, 1999, 12)

It takes a good artist to use new materials and make them into a work of art. The danger is, I think, in making the physicality of the material so important that it becomes the idea of the work. (15)

Conceptual art is not necessarily logical. The logic of a piece of series of pieces is a device that is used at times only be ruined. Logic may be used to camouflage the real intent of the artist, to lull the view into the belief that he understands the work, or to infer a prardoxical situation (such as logic vs. illogic) (13)

What the work of art looks like isn't too important. It has to look lie something if it has physical form. No matter what form it may finally have it must begin with an idea. It is the process of conception and realization with which the artists is concerned. (13)

To work with a plan that is pre-set is one way of avoiding subjectivity. It also obviates the necessity of designing each work in turn. The plan would design the work. Some plans would require millions of variations, and some a limited number, but both are finite. Other plans imply infinity. In each case, however, the artist would select the basic form and rules that would govern the solution of the problem. After that the fewer decisions made in the course of completing the work, the better. This eliminates the arbitrary, the capricious, and the subjective as mcuh as possible. (13)
