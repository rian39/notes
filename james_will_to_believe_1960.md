There are, then, cases where a fact cannot come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming 25 {#knowing} {#belief}

I, therefore, for one, cannot see my way to accepting the agnostic rules for truth-seeking, or wilfully agree to keeping my willing nature out of the game. 28 {#belief} {#thought}

 we have the right to believe at our own risk any hypothesis that is live enough to tempt our will. 29

 Whatever else be certain, this at least is certain,--that the world of our present natural knowledge _is_ enveloped in a larger world of _some_ sort of whose residual properties we at present can frame no positive idea. 53

It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all. And often enough our faith beforehand in an uncertified result _is the only thing that makes the result come true_. Suppose, for instance, that you are climbing a mountain, and have worked yourself into a position from which the only escape is by a terrible leap. Have faith that you can successfully make it, and your feet are nerved to its accomplishment. But mistrust yourself, and think of all the sweet things you have heard the scientists say of maybes, and you will hesitate so long that, at last, all unstrung and trembling, and launching yourself in a moment of despair, you roll in the abyss. In such a case (and it belongs to an enormous class), the part of wisdom as well as of courage is to _believe what is in the line of your needs_, for only by such belief is the need fulfilled. Refuse to believe, and you shall indeed be right, for you shall irretrievably perish. 34

Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is still theoretically possible; and as the test of belief is willingness to act, one may say that faith is the readiness to act in a cause the prosperous issue of which is not certified to us in advance. It is in fact the same moral quality which we call courage in practical affairs; and there will be a very widespread tendency in men of vigorous nature to enjoy a certain amount of uncertainty in their philosophic creed, just as risk lends a zest to worldly activity.48

 Please remember that optimism and pessimism are definitions of the world, and that our own reactions on the world, small as they are in bulk, are integral parts of the whole thing, and necessarily help to determine the definition. They may even be the decisive elements in determining the definition. A large mass can have its unstable equilibrium overturned by the addition {61} of a feather's weight;


As soon, in short, as we are enabled from any cause whatever to think with perfect fluency, the thing we think of seems to us _pro tanto_ rational. Whatever modes of conceiving the cosmos facilitate this fluency, produce the sentiment of rationality. Conceived in such modes, being vouches for itself and needs no further philosophic formulation 64
