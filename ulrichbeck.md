What is globalization? Ulrich Beck; translated by Patrick Camiller. First published in 2000 by Polity Press Cambridge

By globalism I mean the view that the world market eliminates or supplants political action - that is, the ideology of rule by the world market, the ideology of neoliberalism. 9

The striking thing is that globalism, understood in this way, casts its spell even over its opponents. Along with affirmative globalism, there is also a 'negative' globalism which, having been convinced of the inescapable dominance of the world Market, takes refuge in various forms of protectionism.

Our own life is the locus of the glocal. How is this possible? One's own life is no longer tied to a particular place; it is not a staid, settled life. It is a life 'on the road' (in a direct and transferred sense), a nomadic life, a life in car, aeroplane and train, on the telephone and Internet, a transnational life media-supported and media-stamped. 74

If we are to understand the social figure of a globalization of personal life, we must focus on the oppositions involved in stretching between different places. This requires, among other things, that mobility should be understood in a new way. 75

What is coming to the fore is the inner mobility of an individual's own life, for which coming and going, being both here and there across frontiers at the same time, has become the normal thing.  75

One could say it has become second nature to keep having to 'find one's place', between different places each with their special social demands. (Beck, 2000, 75)

The multiple location or transnationality of individual biographies, the globalization of people's lives, is a farther reason why national sovereignty is being undermined and a nationally based sociology is becoming obsolete. The association of place with community or society is breaking down. The changing and choosing of place is the model for biographical globalization. 74
