It is therefore true that God makes the world by calculating, but his calculation never work out exactly, and this inexactitude or injustice in the result, this irreducible inequality, forms the condition of the world. The world can be regarded as a 'remainder', and the real in the world understood in terms of fractional or even incommensurable numbers. Every phenomenon refers to an inequality by which it is conditioned. [@Deleuze_2001, 222] {#calculation} {#difference}

Ideas have the power to affirm divergence; they establish a kind of resonance between divergent series. It is probably that the notions of singular and regular, distinctive and ordinary, have for philosophy an ontological and epistemological importance much greater than those of truth and falsity in relation to representation: for what is called sense  depends upon the distinction and distribution of these shining points in the structure of a given Idea. 278 {#structure} {#concept} {#thought}

his conception of the Idea as an ensemble of differential relations and singular points, the manner in which he begins with the inessential and the constructs essences in the form of centres of envelopment around singularities, his presentiment of divergences, his procedure of vice-diction, his approximation of an inverse ratio between the distinct and the clear, all show why the ground rumbles with greater power in the case of Leibniz, why the intoxication and giddiness as less feigned in his case [@Deleuze_1994, 264] {#ensemble} -2

We are right to speak of repetition when we find ourselves confronted by identical elements with exactly the same concept. However, we must distinguish between these discrete elements, these repeated objects, and a secret subject, the real subject of repetition, which repeats itself through them. ... For there is no repetition without a repeater, nothing repeated without a repetitious soul. 23

In every case, repetition is difference without a concept. But in one case, the difference is taken to be only external to the concept; ... In the other case, the difference is internal to the Idea; it unfolds as pure movement, creative of a dynamic space and time which corresponds to the Idea. 23-4

The two repetitions are not independent. One is the singular subject, the interiority and heart of the other, the depth of the other. 24

It is in this sense that the differential relations and distinctive points already indicate centres of envelopment within the continuum, centres of possible implication or involution which are brought about by individual essences. 47

Oppositions are roughly cut from a delicate milieu of overlapping perspectives, of communicating distances, divergences and disparities, of heterogeneous potentials and intensities. Nor is it primarily a question of dissolving tensions in the identical, but rather of distributing the disparities in a multiplicity.50

The simulacrum is the instance which includes a difference within itself, such as (at least) two divergent series on which it plays, all resemblance abolished so that one can no longer point to the existence of an original and a copy.  ... It is here that we find the lived reality of a sub-representative domain. 69

It is memory that grounds time. 79

In order to be represented the former present must resemble the present one, and must be broken into partially simultaneous presents with very different durations which are then contiguous with one another and, even as the limit, contiguous with the present present. 80

Active synthesis, therefore, has two correlative – albeit non-symmetrical – aspects: reproduction and reflection, remembrance and recognition, memory and understanding. 80

The passive synthesis of habit constituted time as a contraction of instants with respect to a present, but the active synthesis of memory constitutes it as the embedding of presents themselves. 81 {#embedding} {#habit}

Material repetition comes undone even as it occurs, and can be represented only by the active synthesis which projects its elements into a space of conservation and calculation. 84

An animal forms an eye for itself by causing scattered and luminous excitations to be reproduced on a privileged surfaces of its body. The eye binds light, it is itself a bound light. 96

The first characteristic seems to us to be organisation in series. A system must be constituted on the basis of two or more series, each series being defined by the differences between the terms which compose it. 117

Once communication between heterogeneous series is established, all sorts of consequences follow within the system. Something passes between the borders, events explode, phenomena flash, like thunder and lightning. Spatio-temporal dynamisms fill the system, expressing simultaneously the resonance of the coupled series and the amplitude of the forced movement which exceeds them. 118

We call this dark precursor, this difference in itself or difference in the second degree which relates heterogeneous systems and even completely different things, the disparate.  120

These differential systems with their disparate and resonating series, their dark precursors and forced movements, are what we call simulacra or phantasms. 126

It cannot be regarded as a fact that thinking is the natural exercise of a faculty, and that this faculty is possessed of a good nature and a good will. ‘Everybody’ knows very well that in fact men think rarely, and more often under the impulse of a shock than in the excitement of a taste for thinking. 132

Perhaps in effect, as we shall see, it will be necessary to reserve the name of Ideas not for pure cogitanda  but rather for those instances which go from sensibility to thought and from thought to sensibility, capable of engendering in each case, according to their own order, the limit- or transcendent-object of each faculty. 146

Ideas are problems. 146

In fact, we are confronted with great difficulties in thinking: lack of method, technique or applications, and even lack of health. 146

Henceforth, thought is also forced to think its central collapse, its fractures, its own natural 'powerlessness' which is indistinguishable from its greatest power – in other words, from those unformulated forces, the cogitanda, as though from so many thefts or trespasses in thought. 147

How is stupidity (not error) possible?

It is possible by virtue of the link between thought and individuation. This link is much profound than that which appears in the ‘I think’: it is established in a field of intensity which already constitutes the sensibility of the thinking subject. 151

Actualisation takes place in three series: space, time and also consciousness. Every spatio-temporal dynamism is accompanied by the emergence of an elementary consciousness which itself traces directions, doubles movements and migrations, and is born on the threshold of the condensed singularities of the body or object whose consciousness it is. 220

No doubt the high and the low, the right and the left, the figure and the ground are individuating factors which trace rises and falls, currents and descents in extensity. However, since they take place within an already developed extensity, their value is only relative. They therefore flow from a ‘deeper’ instance – depth itself, which is not an extension but a pure implex. (229)

Never have so many, so diverse and such demented operations been multiplied in order to draw from the depths an intensive spatium  a serene and docile extensity, and to dispel a Difference which subsists in itself even when it is cancelled outside itself. 234

More generally, every field of forces refers back to a potential energy, every opposition refers to a deeper ‘disparateness’, and oppositions are resolved in time and extensity only to the extent that the disparates have first invented their communication in depth and rediscovered that dimension in which they envelop one another, tracing hardly recognisable intensive paths through the ulterior world of qualified extensity. 236

‘difference pursues its subterranean life while its image reflected by the surface is scattered’ 240

Intensity is the determinant in the process of actualisation.. It is intensity which dramatises. 245

However, each intensity clearly expresses only certain relations or certain degrees of variation. Those that it expresses clearly are precisely those on which it is focused when it has the enveloping  role. In its role as the enveloped, it still expresses all relations and all degrees, but confusedly. 252

Every body, every thing, thinks and is a thought to the extent that, reduced to its intensive reasons, it expresses an Idea the actualisation of which it determines. 254 {#body} {#thought}

Intensity creates the extensities and the qualities in which it is explicated; these extensities and qualities are differenciated.  ... It is nevertheless true that intensity is explicated only in being cancelled in this differenciated system that it creates. 254-55

Finally, to the extent that every phenomenon finds its reason in a difference of intensity which frames it, as though this constituted the boundaries between which it flashes, we claim that complex systems increasingly tend to interiorise their constitutive differences: the centres of envelopment carry out this interiorisation of the individuating factors. 256

That is why, in order to represent repetition, contemplative souls must be installed here and there; passive selves, sub-representative syntheses and habituses capable of contracting the cases or the elements into one another, in order that they can subsequently be reconstituted within a space or time of conservation which belongs to representation itself. The consequences of this are very important: since this contraction is a difference or a modification of the contemplative soul - indeed, the modification of this soul, the only modification which truly belongs to it and after which it dies - it appears that the most material repetition occurs only by means of and within a difference which is drawn off by contraction, by means of and within a soul which draws a difference from repetition. Repetition is therefore represented, but on the condition of a soul of a quite different nature: contemplative and contracting, but non-representing and non-represented. Matter is, in effect, populated or covered by such souls, which provide it with a depth without which it would present no bare repetition on the surface. Nor should we believe that the contraction is external to what it contracts, or that this difference is external to the repetition: it is an integral part..of it, the constituent part, the depth without which nothing would repeat on the surface. 286 {#repetition} {#habit}
