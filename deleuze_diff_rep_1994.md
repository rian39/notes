Deleuze, Gilles. Difference and Repetition. Translated by Paul Patton, Athlone Contemporary European Thinkers. (London ; New York: Continuum, 2001).

Ideas have the power to affirm divergence; they establish a kind of resonance between divergent series. It is probably that the notions of singular and regular, distinctive and ordinary, have for philosophy an ontological and epistemological importance much greater than those of truth and falsity in relation to representation: for what is called sense  depends upon the distinction and distribution of these shining points in the structure of a given Idea. 278 {#structure} {#concept} {#thought}
