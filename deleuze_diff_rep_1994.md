Deleuze, Gilles. Difference and Repetition. Translated by Paul Patton, Athlone Contemporary European Thinkers. (London ; New York: Continuum, 2001).

It is therefore true that God makes the world by calculating, but his calculation never work out exactly, and this inexactitude or injustice in the result, this irreducible inequality, forms the condition of the world. The world can be regarded as a 'remainder', and the real in the world understood in terms of fractional or even incommensurable numbers. Every phenomenon refers to an inequality by which it is conditioned. [@Deleuze_2001, 222] {#calculation} {#difference}

Ideas have the power to affirm divergence; they establish a kind of resonance between divergent series. It is probably that the notions of singular and regular, distinctive and ordinary, have for philosophy an ontological and epistemological importance much greater than those of truth and falsity in relation to representation: for what is called sense  depends upon the distinction and distribution of these shining points in the structure of a given Idea. 278 {#structure} {#concept} {#thought}
