We can _any_ set that satisfies these properties (or axioms) a *vector space*, and the objects in the set are called *vectors*. 166

We call this type of definition an *abstraction* because we are abstracting a collection of properties from a particular setting $R^n$ to form the axioms for a more general setting. 166

A vector can be a real number, an _n_-tuple, a matrix, a polynomial, a continuous function, and so on. 169
