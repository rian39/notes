A clear difference, then, between how the concepts of essence and existence are commonly employed in the context of human mobility is the following. The idea of essential mobilities is mostly used at a macro-social level, whereby the movements under consideration seem not to be valued as such but because they serve a purpose that is considered crucial in contemporary society. The most obvious example is the organization of commuter travel, so that people can move smoothly between their home and workplace(s), which is vital to keep the economy going. Existential mobilities, in contrast, are discussed mostly at the level of the individual (as if this were solely a personal interest or responsibility). Both concepts thus reveal different, and at times conflicting, processes of making mobilities meaningful. The fine line between essential and existential mobility is not always that clear (and is often deliberately left fuzzy). It is in exceptional circumstances, such as situations of crisis, that the (dis)connections between essential and existential mobilities, and the way they are interpreted by various stakeholders in society, become more pronounced.
