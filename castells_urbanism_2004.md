There is a growing tension and articulation between the space of flows and the space of places. 

The space of flows links up electronically separate locations in an interactive network that connects activities and people in distinct geographical contexts. The space of places organizes experience and activity around the confines of locality. Cities are structured, and destructured simultaneously by the competing logics of the space of flows and the space of places. (85) {#network} {#city-platform}

Our urban life fabric, as (Mitchell 1999) has pointed out, becomes an e-topia,  a new urban form  in which we constantly interact, deliberately or automatically, with online information systems, increasingly in the wireless mode. Materially speaking, the space of flows is folded into the space of places (86).

Moving physically while keeping the networking connection to everything we do is a new realm of the human adventure, on which we know little. (87).
