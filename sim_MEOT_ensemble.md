21-                  Presentation written in 1958 by Gilbert Simondon
21- The book titled On the M ode 0f Existence 0f Technical O bjects aims at introducing
21- a knowledge into culture that is adequate to technical objects considered on three
21:levels: elements, individuals, ensembles. A gap manifests itself in our civilization
21- between the attitudes provoked in man by the technical object and the true nature
21- of these objects; from this inadequate and confused rapport a set of mythologi­
21- cal valuations and devaluations arises in the consumer, the manufacturer, and the
21- worker; in order to replace this inadequate rapport with a veritable relation, one

--

21- form just as an axiomatic saturates, each element fulfills not only a function in the
21- whole [ensemble] but a function of the whole. There is something like a redundancy
21- of information in the technical object having become concrete.
21-    This notion of information allows the general evolution of technical objects
21:to be interpreted via the succession of elements, of individuals and of ensembles,
21- according to the law of conservation of technicity. The veritable progress of tech­
21- nical objects takes place through a schema of relaxation and not of continuity:
21- there is a preservation throughout the successive cycles of evolution of technicity
21- as information.

22-  xvi
22-     The second phase envisions the rapport between man and the technical object,
22-  on the one hand at the level of the individual, and on the other hand, at the level
22: of ensembles. The individual's mode of access to the technical object is m inor or
22-  m ajor; the minor mode is the mode appropriate for the knowledge 0f the tool or the
22- instrument; it is primitive, but adequate to this level of the existence of technicity
22- in the form of tools or instruments; it turns man into a bearer of tools, according
22- to a concrete apprenticeship, a sort 0f instinctive symbiosis of man and the techni­

--

22- improvement of elements; the pessimistic and dramatic progress 0f the 19th cen­
22- tury corresponds to the replacement 0f the individual human tool bearer by the
22- machine individual, as well as corresponding to the anxiety resulting from the
22- frustration of this progress. Finally, what remains to be elaborated is a new notion
22:of progress corresponding to the discovery 0f technics at the level of the ensembles
22- of our epoch, by virtue of a deepening of the theory 0f information and communi­
22- cation: the true nature of man is not to be a tool bearer — and thus a competitor
22- of the machine, but man's nature is that 0f the inventor of technical and living
22- objects capable of resolving problems of compatibility between machines within
22:an ensemble; he coordinates and organizes their mutual relation at the level o f
22- machines, between machines; more than simply governing them, he renders them
22- compatible, he is the agent and translator of information from machine to machine,
22- intervening within the margin of indeterminacy harbored by the open machine's
22- way of functioning, which is capable of receiving information. Man constructs the

--

23- most primitive and the most elaborate of all thoughts, philosophical thought, that
23- a truly n eu tral and balan ced because complete, mediation between opposing phases
23- can intervene. It is thus philosophical thought alone that can assume the knowl­
23- edge, valorization and completion of the phase of technicity within the entirety
23:[ensemble] of man’s modes of being in the world, by way of a meditation regarding
23- the rapport between science and technics, theology and mysticism.

--

31- responds not to an increase of automatism, but on the contrary to the fact that
31- the operation of a machine harbors a certain margin of indeterminacy. It is this
31- margin that allows the machine to be sensitive to outside information. Much more
31- than any increase in automatism, it is this sensitivity to information on the part of
31:machines that makes a technical ensemble possible. A purely automatic machine
31- completely closed in on itself in a predetermined way of operating would only be
31- capable of yielding perfunctory results. The machine endowed with a high degree
31- of technicity is an open machine, and all open machines taken together [l ’ensem ble
31- des m achines ouvertes] presuppose man as their permanent organizer, as the living

--

32-    is what allows the same machine to extract cube roots or to translate a simple
32-    text, composed of a small number of words and expressions, from one language
32-    into another.
32-        It is also through the intermediary 0f this margin 0f indeterminacy and not
32:   through automatisms that machines can be grouped into coherent ensembles and
32-    exchange information with one another via the intermediary of the coordinator
32-    that is the human interpreter. Even when two machines exchange information
32-    directly (as between a master oscillator and another pulse synchronized oscillator),
32-    man intervenes as a being who regulates the margin of indeterminacy in order to

--

33- who would be like a sociologist or psychologist of machines, living in the midst of
33- this society of technical beings as its responsible and inventive consciousness.
33-     A genuine awareness of technical realities, grasped in their signification, corre­
33- sponds to an open plurality of techniques. It cannot, moreover, be otherwise because
33:a technical ensemble, even one that is not very extensive, comprises machines whose
33- principles of operation are derived from very different scientific domains. So-called
33- “technical” specialization most often corresponds to matters that are, strictly
33- speaking, external to the technical objects (public relations, a particular form of
33- commerce), rather than corresponding to a kind of operational schema within the

--

34-    nation that gives it its consistency at the end-point of a process of evolution, thus
34-    proving that it cannot be considered as a mere utensil.
34-       The modalities of this genesis enable one to grasp the three levels of the technical
34-    object and their non-dialectical temporal coordination: the element, the individ­
34:   ual, and the ensemble.
34-       Once the technical object is defined through its genesis, it becomes possible to
34-    study the relations between the technical object and other realities, in particular
34-    that of man at the stage of adulthood or childhood.
34-       Lastly, considered as an object of value judgment, the technical object can pro­

35:of the element, at the level of the individual, or at the level of the ensemble.
35- At the level of the element, the process of its improvement does not introduce any
35- upheavals that would engender anxiety by conflicting with acquired habits: this is
35- the climate of eighteenth century optimism, which introduces the idea of contin­
35- uous and indefinite progress, bringing about the constant improvement 0f mans

--

35- does. To this phase corresponds a dramatic and impassioned notion of progress,
35- which turns into the rape of nature, the conquest 0f the world, and the exploitation
35- of energies. This will to power expresses itself in the technophile and technocratic
35- excesses of the thermodynamic era, which take on both a prophetic and cataclys­
35:mic spin. Finally, at the level of the technical ensembles of the twentieth century,
35- this thermodynamic energeticism is replaced by information theory, whose content
35- is normative and eminently regulative and stabilizing: the development of technics
35- appears to be a guarantee of stability. The machine, as an element 0f the techni­
35:cal ensemble, becomes that which increases the quantity of information, increases
35- negentropy, and opposes the degradation of energy: the machine, being a work of
35- organization and information, is, like life itself and together with life, that which
35- is opposed to disorder, to the leveling of all things tending to deprive the universe
35- of the power of change. The machine is that through which man fights against the

--

35-    This modification of the philosophical way of looking at the technical object
35- announces the possibility of introducing the technical being into culture: this inte­
35- gration, which could not have taken place in a definitive way at the level of elements
35- or at the level of individuals, will have a greater chance of stability at the level of
35:ensembles; once technical reality has become regulative it can be integrated into
35- culture, which is regulative in its essence. This integration could only have occurred
35- by way of addition in the age when technicity resided in its elements, or by way
35- of a breach and a revolution in the age when technicity resided in new technical
35:individuals; today, technicity tends to reside in ensembles. For this reason, it can
35- become a foundation for culture, to which it will bring a unifying and stabilizing
35- power, making culture adequate to the reality which it expresses and regulates.

41- an imperfection, unless this exchange itself belongs to the theoretical operation;
41- furthermore there is a primitive form of the technical object, the abstract fo rm , in
41- which each theoretical and material unit is treated as an absolute, and is completed
41- according to an intrinsic perfection that requires, in order for it to function, that
41:it be constituted as a closed system; integration into an ensemble in this case raises
41- a series of so-called technical problems that must be resolved and which are in fact
41:problems of compatibility between already given ensembles.
41:     These already given ensembles need to be maintained and preserved despite their
41- reciprocal influences. What appears then are particular structures that one can call,
41- for each constitutive unit, defense structures: the cylinder head of the thermal
41- combustion engine bristles with cooling fins that are particularly well developed
41- in the region of the valves, which is subject to intense thermal exchanges and high

--

42- heads fins by sawing or grinding, then the volumetric unit constituted by the
42- cylinder head alone would no longer be viable, even as a volumetric unit: it would
42- be deformed under the gaseous pressure; the volumetric and mechanical unit has
42- become coextensive with the unit 0f thermal dissipation because the structure of
42:the ensemble is bivalent: the fins constitute a cooling surface of thermal exchanges
42- with the stream 0f external air; these same fins, insofar as they are a part of the
42- cylinder head, limit the size 0f the combustion chamber through their un-deform-
42- able contour, using less metal than would be required by a shell without ribs; the
42- development of this unique structure is not a compromise, but a concomitance

--

43- system of requirements.
43-      Conversely, during the industrial stage, the object achieves its coherence and it
43-  is the system of needs that is now less coherent than the system of the object; needs
43-  mold themselves onto the industrial technical object, which in turn acquires the
43: power to shape a civilization. It is utilization that becomes an ensemble chiseled to

--

46- the theater of a certain number of reciprocal causal relations.
46-     It is due to these relations, given certain limits of the conditions of utilization,
46- that the object encounters obstacles within its own operation: the play 0f limits,
46- whose overcoming constitutes progress, resides in the incompatibilities that arise from
46:the progressive saturation 0f the system 0f sub- ensembles;1 yet because of its very nature,
46- this overcoming can occur only as a leap, as a modification of the internal distri­
46- bution of functions, a rearrangement of their system; what was once an obstacle2

49- with targeted beams is equivalent to a pentode; it is even superior in its function as
49- a power amplifier of acoustic frequencies, because of the lower degree of distortion
49- it produces. The adjunction of a supplementary structure only constitutes genuine
49- progress for the technical object if this structure incorporates itself concretely into
49:the totality [ensemble] 0f dynamical schemas of functioning; for this reason we will
49- say that the tetrode with targeted beams is more concrete than the pentode.
49-    One must not confuse the increase 0f the concrete aspect of the technical object
49- with the increase 0f the technical objects possibilities via a complication of its
49- structure; for instance, a twin-grid lamp (which allows separate action on two inde­

50- structural element fulfills several functions rather than a single one; but these two
50- processes are in fact tied to each other; differentiation is possible because, in a
50- conscious and calculated manner and in view of a necessary result, it enables the
50- integration of correlative effects of the global functioning into the functioning of
50:the ensemble, effects which had until then been more or less corrected by pallia­
50- tives that were separate from the principle function.
50-    The same type of evolution is noticeable in the passage from the Crookes tube
50- to the Coolidge tube; the first is not only less efficient than the second; it is also
50- less stable in its functioning, and more complex; the Crookes tube in fact uses the

--

51- the groups 0f synergetic functions are allocated to specific structures; each struc­
51- ture attains a greater functional wealth from this redistribution as well as a more
51- perfect structural precision; this is the case for the cathode, which, rather than
51- being a simple spherical cap or hemisphere made 0f any kind 0f metal, becomes
51:an ensemble consisting 0f a parabolic bowl at the heart 0f which there is a filament
51- producing thermo-electrons; the anode, which in the Crookes tube occupied an
51- indifferent position with respect to the cathode, converges geometrically with the
51- previous anticathode; the new anode-anticathode plays the two synergetic roles:
51- that of the production 0f a potential difference with respect to the cathode (the role

52- constitutes the true sub-system in the technical object. It is because of this search
52- for synergies that the technical object's concretization can translate into an element
52- 0f simplification; the concrete technical object is one that is no longer in conflict
52- with itself, one in which no side-effect is detrimental to the functioning of the
52:ensemble or left out of this functioning. In this manner and for this reason a func­
52- tion can be fulfilled by several synergistically associated structures in the technical
52- object that has become concrete, whereas in the primitive and abstract technical
52- object each structure is charged with the accomplishment of a definite function,
52- and generally only one. The essence of the technical objects concretization is the
52:organization of functional sub- ensembles within the total functioning; on the basis
52- of this principle one can understand in what sense the redistribution of functions
52- occurs in the network of different structures, both in the abstract technical object
52- and in the concrete technical object: each structure fulfills several functions; but
52- in the abstract technical object, it only fulfills one essential and positive function,

55-    Should one therefore consider the invention of the rotating anode to be a struc­
55- tural concretization of the Coolidge tube? — No, because it mostly plays the role
55- of diminishing an inconvenience that couldn’t be converted into a positive effect
55:of the overall functioning [fonctionnement d'ensemble]. The inconvenience of the
55- Coolidge tube, the residual aspect of antagonism that subsists in its functioning,
55- is the poor yield of its conversion of kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation;
55- this poor yield probably does not constitute a direct antagonism between func­
55- tions, but it does practically convert into a real antagonism; if the tungsten plate

56- phy tubes is currently on the order of several kilowatts.
56-     In this sense, one can say that minor improvements obstruct major improve­
56- ments, because they may mask the technical objects true imperfections by
56- compensating for true antagonisms with an inessential artifice that is incompletely
56:integrated into the functioning of the ensemble; the danger of abstraction recurs
56- once again at the level of minor improvements; for instance, the Coolidge tube
56- with a rotating anode is less concrete than a tube with static cooling facilitated by
56- a copper bar and air cooling fins; if, for whatever reason, the rotation of the anode
56- stops during the tubes functioning, the point receiving the concentrated beam

73- rounding the technical being, linked to a certain regime of elements that constitute
73- the technical being. The associated milieu mediates the relation between technical,
73- fabricated elements and natural elements, at the heart of which the technical being
73:functions. Such is the case of the ensemble constituted by oil and water moving in
73:and around the Guimbal turbine. This ensemble is concretized and individualized
73- by recurrent thermal exchanges that take place within it: the faster the turbine
73- spins, the more there is an increase in the heat generated by the generator through
73- magnetic losses and the Joule effect; but the faster the turbine spins, the greater

74- function is only rarely the work of chance; it requires putting into play a capacity
74- to organize the elements according to certain requirements which act as an ensem­
74- ble, as a directive value, and play the role of symbols representing the future
74:ensemble that does not yet exist. The unity of the future associated milieu, within
74- which the causal relations will be deployed that will enable the functioning of the
74- new technical object, is represented , it is played or acted out as much as a role can be
74- played in the absence of the true character, by way of the schemes of the creative
74- imagination. The dynamism of thought is the same as that of technical objects;

76- ground and forms in psychic life: the associated milieu no longer regulates the

77- III. - Technical in d iv id u alizatio n

77- The technical objects principle of individualization through recurrent causality 77- within an associated milieu enables us to think with greater clarity about certain 77:technical ensembles and to know whether to treat them as a technical individual 77- or as a collection of organized individuals. We shall speak of a technical individual 77- whenever the associated milieu exists as a condition of functioning sine qua non , 77:whereas it is an ensemble in the contrary case. Take a laboratory, such as a labora­ 77- tory studying the physiology 0f sensation. Is an audiometer a technical individual? 77- No, not if one considers it independently of the power supply and headphones 77- or speakers used as electro-acoustic transducers. The audiometer is defined, then, 77- by certain requisite conditions of temperature, voltage, and noise levels, so that --

77- for the audiometer to operate properly it requires either a flat and barren land­ 77- scape, or that its measurements be made in an anechoic chamber, with a suspended 77- anti-microphonic floor and a thick layer of glass-wool on the walls. What then is 77- the audiometer in itself, such as it is sold by a manufacturer or such as one makes 77:oneself? It is an ensemble of technical forms, wherein each has a relative indi­ 77- viduality; in general it has two high-frequency oscillators, where one is fixed and 77- the other variable; the lower of the two frequency beats serves to produce audible 77- sound; a fader facilitates the dosage of the intensity of the stimuli. Neither of these 77- oscillators constitutes a technical object in itself, because in order for it to be stable 

77 - to be conditioned by the natural and technical external milieu; this milieu would - become a truly associated milieu only if a random drift in frequency in one of the - oscillators were, as a consequence, to entail variation in the supply voltage oppos­ - ing this frequency drift; there would be an exchange through reciprocal causality :between regulated supply and the oscillators; it is the ensemble of technical struc­ -  tures that would thereby be self-stabilized; here, on the contrary, only the supply is self-stabilized and it does not react upon random variations in the frequency of -  one of the oscillators.

--

78- another rather than resulting in a regulatory reaction; the structures attached to
78- the same associated milieu have to function synergistically. For this very reason the
78- audiometer comprises at least two distinct parts that cannot be stabilized by the
78- same associated milieu: the frequency generator on the one hand and the ampli­
78:fier- fader on the other. An action by one of these ensembles on the other must be
78- avoided, which notably leads to the careful separation of both their power supplies
78- and to electrically and magnetically shielding the partition that separates them,
78- in order to avoid any interaction. The material limit of the audiometer, however,
78- is not a functional limit; the amplifier-fader is normally extended by way of the
78- acoustic transducer and by the room or external ear of the subject, depending on
78- whether or not one employs speakers or headphones for coupling with the subject.
78- Henceforth, one can posit the existence of relative levels of individualization of
78- technical objects. This criterion has an axio lo gical value : the coherence of a technical
78:ensemble is at its maximum when this ensemble is constituted by sub- ensembles
78- with the same level of relative individualization. In a laboratory of physiology of
78- sensations there is thus no advantage in grouping the audiometers two oscillators
78- together with the amplifier-fader; however, it is worth grouping the two oscillators
78- together so that both are affected simultaneously and in equal proportion by any

79- EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY                                                       65
79- the amplifier-fader is plugged into, so as to avoid any reaction of variations in the
79- amplifiers anodic consumption of the oscillators’ power supply.
79:   The principle of individualization of technical objects in an ensemble is thus one
79:of the sub- ensembles with recurrent causality in an associated milieu; all technical
79- objects having recurrent causality within their associated milieu must be separated
79- from one another and connected in such a way as to maintain the independence of
79:these associated milieus from one another. The sub- ensemble 0f oscillators and that
79- of the amplifier-fader-transducer must therefore be more than simply independent
79- in terms of power supply, they must also be independent in terms of coupling to
79- each other: amplifier input should be of very high impedance in relation to the
79- oscillators’ output, so as to ensure that any reaction of the amplifier on the oscilla­
79- tors is very weak. If one were, for instance, to plug the fader directly into the outlet
79- of the oscillators, then the setting of this fader might react on the frequency of the
79:oscillators. An ensemble of a higher degree comprising all these sub- ensembles
79- is defined by the capacity to freely realize any form of relation, without thereby
79:destroying the autonomy of individualized sub- ensembles. This for instance is the
79- role of a general power switchboard and wiring-board in a laboratory; electrostatic
79- and electromagnetic shields, the use 0f non-reactive coupling such as what we call
79:the cathode- follow er, aim at maintaining the independence of these sub-ensembles,
79- while also allowing for the diverse combinations among the functioning 0f sub-en­
79- sembles that are necessary; such is the second degree of the functional role of the
79:ensemble that one can call a laboratory, namely the utilization of the results of
79- functioning without any interaction with the conditions of functioning.
79-     We might ask then, on what level is the individuality found: at the level of
79:the sub- ensemble or at that of the ensemble? The answer lies, as always, in the
79:criterion of recurrent causality. At the level of the higher ensemble (such as that
79- of the laboratory) there is indeed no truly associated milieu; if it exists, then it
79- does so only in certain respects, and it is not a general milieu; the presence of
79- oscillators in the room where the experiment in audiometry takes place is often
79- problematic; if the oscillators use transformers with an iron magnetic circuit, then

79- sound due to alternative electrical attractions. For fine-tuned experiments it is nec­
79-  essary to place the devices in another room and to operate them by remote control,
79-  or to isolate the subject in an anechoic chamber. The same applies to the magnetic
79-  radiation of power transformers, which can be very problematic in electro-enceph-
79: alographic and electrocardiogiaphic experiments. A superior ensemble such as a

80:creating associated milieus by accident. The ensemble distinguishes itself from
80- technical individuals in the sense that the creation of a unique associated milieu is
80:undesirable; the ensemble is comprised of a certain number of devices in order to
80- counteract this possible creation of a unique associated milieu. It avoids internal
80- concretization of the technical objects it contains, and uses only the results of their

81- orientation that maintains itself after cooling, if the magnetic field is sustained
81- during its cooling and transition into the solid state. Now, the furnace, the melting
81- pot, and the coils creating the magnetic field all together constitute a system that
81:is a technical ensemble; the heat of the furnace shouldn’t have an impact on the
81- coils, the induction field creating the heat in the molten mass shouldn’t neutralize
81- the continuous field aimed at bringing about the magnetization. This technical
81:ensemble is itself constituted of a certain number of technical individuals that are
81- organized in relation to each other, both in view of the result of their functioning
81- and so as to prevent the conditioning of each particular functioning from being
81- disturbed. In the evolution of technical objects we thus witness a passage of causal­
81:ity proceeding from prior ensembles to subsequent elements; such elements, once
81- introduced into an individual whose characteristics they modify, in turn enable
81-  technical causality to rise from the level of the element to that of the individual,
81: then from the level of the individual to the level of the ensemble; here, in a new
81-  cycle, technical causality once more descends to the level of the element via the
81-  process of fabrication, where it reincarnates itself in new individuals and then in
81: new ensembles. There is thus a lineage of causality that is not rectilinear but ser­
81-  rated, where one and the same reality exists first in the form of an element, then as
81: the characteristic of an individual and finally as the characteristic of an ensemble.

83- through the form of the locomotive. High tonnage transportation, which had now
83- become possible throughout all regions, and which was no longer constrained to
83- the contour lines and meandering of navigable tracks, led to the industrial concen­
83- tration of the nineteenth century, which not only incorporates individuals whose
83- functioning principle is based on thermodynamics, but is essentially thermody­
83- namic in its structures; it is therefore around coal sources of thermal energy and
83- close to the sites of the greatest deployment of thermal energy (coal mines and
83:iron works) that the great nineteenth- century industrial ensembles, at the peak

85- what an age has acquired to the one that follows.
85-     For progress to exist, each age must be able to pass on to the next age the fruit
85- borne of its technical effort; what is capable of being passed on from one age to
85:another are neither technical ensembles, nor even individuals, but the elements
85:that these individuals, grouped as ensembles, were able to produce; thanks to their
85:capacity of internal inter- commutation, technical ensembles in fact have the pos­
85- sibility of going beyond themselves by producing elements that differ from their

86- to enable the construction 0f new technical beings in the form of individuals; there

86- ened and keep its sharpness even when employed to work on hard wood. This latter
86:quality in turn results from the technical ensemble employed to produce the tool.
86- It is because it is a fabricated element that the adze can be made of a metal whose
86- composition varies at different points; this tool is not only a hunk of metal shaped
86- into a certain form; it has been forged, which is to say that the molecular chains

86:the functioning of a technical ensemble. In order to make a good adze a technical
86:ensemble of a foundry, forge, and quench hardening is required.

86- within it, adds itself to a first determination given by the relation between form and

87- EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY                                                        73
87- was this concretization that gave Toledo’s blades their value and prestige, and more
87- recently, led to the quality of Saint-Etienne s steel. These types of steel express the
87:result of the functioning of a technical ensemble comprising in equal measure the
87- qualities of coal used, as well as the temperature and chemical composition of the
87- soft water of the Furan river, or the species of green wood used to stir and refine the
87- molten metal prior to casting. In certain cases, technicity becomes predominant
87- with respect to the abstract aspects of the relation between matter and form. A coil
87- spring is thus a very simple thing in form and matter, yet the fabrication of springs
87:requires a high degree of perfection in the technical ensemble that produces them.
87- The quality of individuals, such as an engine or an amplifier, often depends much
87- more on the technicity of simple elements (valve springs, for instance, or a modu­
87- lation transformer) than on the ingenuity 0f their assembly. Technical assemblies,
87- however, that are capable of producing certain simple elements, such as a spring or

87- ation to say that the quality of a simple needle expresses the degree 0f perfection
87- of a nations industry. This explains why there are judgments that are legitimate
87- enough in both practical and technical terms, such as when a needle is specifically
87- called an “English needle.” Such judgments have a practical sense, because techni­
87:cal ensembles express themselves in the simplest elements they produce. This mode
87- of thought of course exists for other reasons besides those that legitimate it, and
87- particularly because it is easier to qualify a technical object by its origin than to
87- judge its intrinsic value; what we have here is a phenomenon of opinion; but even
87- if this phenomenon gives rise to numerous exaggerations or intentional exploita­
87- tion, it is not without foundation.
87-      Technicity can be considered a positive aspect 0f the element, analogous to
87- the self-regulation exerted by the associated milieu in the technical individual.
87- Concretization is technicity at the level of the element; it is the reason why the ele­
87:ment is really an element produced by an ensemble, rather than being an ensemble
87:itself or an individual; this characteristic makes it detachable from the ensemble
87- and frees it so that new individuals may be constituted. There is of course no
87- peremptory reason why one would attribute technicity only to the element; the
87- associated milieu is the depositary of technicity at the level of the individual, just
87:as extension is the depositary of inter- commutativity at the level of the ensemble;
87-  it is nevertheless good to reserve the term technicity for this quality of the element,
87:which expresses and preserves what has been acquired via a technical ensemble so as
87-  to be transported into a new period. What the element transports is a concretized

88- 74                        ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS
88:technical reality, whereas the individual and the ensemble contain this technical
88- reality without being able to transport and transmit it; elements have a transduc­
88- tive property that makes them the true bearers of technicity, just as seeds transport
88- the properties of a species and go on to make new individuals. It is thus within
88- elements that technicity exists in the purest way, in a free state as it were, whereas
88:in the individual or the ensemble, technicity only exists in a state of combination.
88-     However, this technicity, borne by the elements, contains no negativity, and no
88- negative conditioning intervenes in the moment of production of elements by the
88:ensembles or of individuals by invention, which reunites the elements in order to
88- form individuals. Invention, which is a creation of the individual, presupposes in
88- the inventor the intuitive knowledge of the element s technicity; invention occurs
88- at this intermediate level between the concrete and the abstract, which is the level
88- of schemas, and presupposes the pre-existence and coherence of representations

88- technical, with respect to which an individual being is discovered as that which
88- is susceptible to incorporating them. The compatibility of elements in a technical
88- individual presupposes the associated milieu: the technical individual must there­
88- fore be imagined, which is to say presupposed as already being constructed in
88:the form of an ensemble of ordered technical schemas; the individual is a stable
88:system of the technicities of elements organized as an ensemble. What is organized
88- are these technicities, as well as the elements as basis of these technicities, not
88- the elements themselves taken in their materiality. An engine is an assemblage of
88- springs, axes, and volumetric systems, each defined by their characteristics and
88- their technicity, not by their materiality; thus, a relative indeterminacy can subsist

90- is equally safe to deploy in a dry atmosphere. Therefore, in many cases, economic 90- considerations do not intervene directly, but through the repercussions that the 90- degree 0f concretization of the technical object has on its deployment in an individual ensemble. It is the general formula of the individual that is subjected to 90- economic repercussions, not that of the element as element. The liaison between 90- the technical and the economic domains occurs at the level of the individual or the 90:ensemble, but very rarely at the level of the element; in this sense, one could say  that technical value is largely independent of economic value and that it can be  appreciated according to independent criteria.

90-    This transmission of technicity by its elements is what grounds the possibil­
90- ity of technical progress, above and beyond the apparent discontinuity of forms,

--

90- progress is all the more certain as each stage tends increasingly and more perfectly
90- toward a state of sole beneficiary.
90-    The technical object is not directly a historical object: it is subject to the course
90- of time only as a vehicle of technicity, according to a transductive role that it plays
90:with respect to a prior age. Neither the technical ensembles nor technical individ­ 90- uals remain; only elements have the power to transmit technicity from one age 90- to another, in the form of an effectuated, accomplished, materialized result. For 90- this reason it is legitimate to analyze the technical object as consisting of technical 90- individuals; but it is necessary to stress that at certain moments in its evolution 90- the technical element makes sense in itself, and is thus a depositary of technicity.
90- In light of this, one can establish the foundation of the analysis of the technics of
90- a human group through the analysis of elements produced by its individuals and
90:its ensembles: often these elements alone have the power to survive the downfall
90- of a civilization, and remain valid witnesses of a state of technical development. In
90- this sense, the method of ethnologists is perfectly valid; but one could prolong its
90- application by equally analyzing the elements produced by industrial techniques.
90-    Indeed, there is no fundamental difference between a people who have no indus­
90- try and those who have a well-developed industry. Even in a people without any
90:industrial development, technical individuals and technical ensembles exist; never­
90- theless, rather than being stabilized by institutions that fix and perpetuate them by
90:installing them, these individuals and ensembles are temporary or even occasional;
90- what is preserved from one technical operation to another are merely the elements,
90- which is to say tools or certain fabricated objects. To build a boat is an operation
90:that requires a truly technical ensemble: a fairly flat ground, yet close to the water,

91- EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY                                                                                               77
91- sheltered yet luminous, with supports and wedges to keep the ship standing while
91:it is being built. The shipyard, like the technical ensemble, can be temporary: it is
91:no less a shipyard constituting an ensemble. Even today similar temporary techni­
91:cal ensembles still exist, sometimes even highly developed and complex ones, such
91- as the construction sites of buildings; others are provisional while being durable,
91- like mining facilities or the drilling rigs for oil exploration.
91:    Not all technical ensembles necessarily take on the stable form of the factory or
91- the workshop. On the other hand it seems that non-industrial civilizations differ­
91- entiate themselves from ours mostly by the absence of technical individuals. This is
91- true only if what is meant is that technical individuals do not exist materially in a
91- stable and permanent way; the function of technical individualization, however, is

--

91- himself technically; it is he who becomes the associated milieu of these diverse
91- tools; when he masters all of his tools, when he recognizes the moment he must
91- change tools in order to continue working or to use two or three tools at a time, he
91- ensures an internal distribution and self-regulation 0f the task9 through his body.
91:In some cases, the integration in the ensemble of technical individuals happens via
91- the intermediary of an association of human individuals working in twos, in threes,
91- or in larger groups; when these groupings do not introduce functional differenti­
91- ation, then their only direct purpose is to increase the available energy or speed of
91- the work, but when differentiation is called for, they clearly demonstrate the gen­
91:esis of an ensemble on the basis of men employed as technical individuals rather
91-  than as human individuals: this was the case with bow drilling, as described by the
91-  authors of classical antiquity; it is still the case with the felling of certain trees; it
91- was also commonly the case, not so long ago, with the use of a two-man cross-cut
91-  saw to make planks or rafters; two men working together in an alternating rhythm.

--

92- and even when they function in a way that produces comparable results, it is very
92- rare that they use procedures identical to the work of an individual man. The
92- analogy is in fact most often very external. Yet if man often feels frustration before
92- the machine, it is because the machine functionally replaces him as an individual:
92:the machine replaces man as tool bearer. In the technical ensembles of industrial
92- civilizations, jobs where several men must work in narrow synchronization are
92- becoming rarer than in a past characterized by the artisanal level. Conversely, at
92- the artisanal level, it is very frequent that certain works require the grouping of
92- human individuals with complementary functions: to shoe a horse, one man is

--

92- machine, the tool bearer; he realizes groupings of machines, but does not him­
92- self bear tools; indeed, the machine accomplishes the core work, the work of the
92- blacksmith and not that 0f the helper; man, disengaged from this function of the
92- technical individual, which is the very essence of the artisanal function, can now
92:become either organizer 0f the ensemble 0f technical individuals, or helper of tech­
92- nical individuals: he greases, cleans, removes detritus and burrs, in other words, in
92- some respects he plays an auxiliary role; he provides the machine with elements,
92- changing the belt, sharpening the drill or the lathe cutting tool. There is thus, in
92- this sense, a role above that of the technical individuality, and one below it: servant
92- and regulator, he supervises the machine, the technical individual, by looking after
92:the relation of the machine with the elements and the ensemble; he is the organizer
92- of relations between technical levels, rather than being himself, like the craftsman,
92- one of the technical levels. A technician therefore adheres less to his professional
92- specialization than does a craftsman.
92-    This nevertheless does not mean that man cannot be a technical individual in

--

94- asymmetrical conductivity, in particular within its rectifier function: it then enters
94- a phase of positive reaction. Allowing it the proper time to cool enables it to return
94- to its normal functioning.
94-    Thus, man can intervene as a substitute for the technical individual, and connect
94:elements with ensembles, in an age when the construction of technical individuals
94- is not possible.
94-    What one must take into account when thinking about the consequences of
94- technical development in relation to the evolution of human societies, is first
94- and foremost the process of the individualization of technical objects; human
94- individuality is increasingly disengaged from the technical function through the
94- construction 0f technical individuals; for man, the functions that remain are both
94- below and above the role of tool bearer, oriented both toward the relation with
94:elements and toward the relation with ensembles. However, as it was precisely the
94- individuality of man that was once employed in technical work, and which had to
94- technicize itself because the machine couldn’t, it became customary to give each
94- human individual just one function in regard to work; this functional monism was
94- perfectly useful and necessary when man became a technical individual. But it now
94- creates unease, because man, who still seeks to be a technical individual, no longer
94- has a stable place alongside the machine: he becomes the servant of the machine
94:or the organizer of the technical ensemble; yet, in order for the human function
94- to make sense, it is necessary for every man employed with a technical task to
94- surround the machine both from above and from below, to have an understand­
94- ing of it in some way, and to look after its elements as well as its integration into
94:the functional ensemble. For it is a mistake to establish a hierarchical distinction
94:between the care given to elements and the care given to ensembles. Technicity
94- is not a reality that can be hierarchized; it exists as a whole inside its elements
94:and propagates transductively throughout the technical individual and ensembles:
94:through the individuals, ensembles are made of elements, and from them elements
94:issue forth. The apparent pre- eminence of ensembles comes from the fact that
94:ensembles are currently given the same prerogatives as those of people playing
94:the role of the boss. Yet ensembles are not in fact individuals; the devaluation of
94- elements equally results from the fact that the use of elements has hitherto been

--

95- proper to helpers and that these elements were not very elaborate. The unease of
95- this situation relating to man and machine thus comes from the fact that one 0f the
95- technical roles, that of the individual, has thus far and until this day been played
95- by men; no longer a technical being, man is, henceforth obliged to learn a new
95:function and to find a place within the technical ensemble that no longer corre­
95- sponds to the technical individual; the first movement consists in occupying two
95- functions that are not individual, that of elements and that of the direction 0f the
95:ensemble; yet in these two functions man finds himself to be in conflict with the
95- memory of himself: man has for so long played the role of the technical individual
95- that the machine, once it has become a technical individual, still appears like a man
95- occupying the place of another man, when it is, on the contrary, man who in fact
95- provisionally replaced the machine before truly technical individuals could emerge.

133- rationalization of forces that situate man by giving him meaning within a human

133- a situation as one simply lives it and is subjected to it. Rather than seeking the
133- procedure for the fabrication of objects without making a pact with matter, man
133- frees himself from his situation of being enslaved by the finality of the whole, by

133-  rates those who create it; it is the product of a human effort of organization, and
133-  12. In past centuries, an important cause of alienation lay in the fact that the human being lent his biological individuality
133: to technical organization: he was bearer 0f tools; technical ensembles could establish themselves only by incorporating man
133-  as tool bearer. The deforming aspect 0f the profession was at once psychic and somatic. The tool bearer was deformed by the
133-  usage of tools. Professional somatic deformations have become rare in the present day. In the repugnance felt by the gentle­
133-  man [l ’honnête homme] toward men of the trade, there is perhaps a part 0f the unpleasant feeling that one has when seeing

143- fact, directly considered automata by the encyclopedists; rather, they are consid­
143- ered an assemblage of elementary devices. Diderot’s collaborators directed their
143- attention essentially to the organs of machines. In the eighteenth century, the tech­
143:nical ensemble was still at the scale of the cork cutter’s workshop or that of the
143:scale maker’s; this ensemble links up with technical elements through the inter­
143- mediary of the craftsman who uses tools or machine-tools, rather than through
143- the intermediary of veritable technical individuals. The division of subjects for
143- study is consequently made according to rubrics of utilization and not according to
143- schemas of technics, i.e., according to types of machines; the principle in grouping

143-  identical tools. This principle of grouping thus leads to a certain superfluity of the
143-  presentation of tools and instruments which, from one illustration to the next, can
143-  be closely related forms.
143:    The principle of grouping according to technical ensembles comprised of an
143-  indefinite plurality of elements, however, is linked very closely to the idea of con­
143-  tinuous progress such as it existed for the Encyclopedists. It is when technicity is

144- and in the eighteenth century arose the idea 0f the continuity of progress as a
144- forward march in what we have called the concretization of technical objects. The
144- evolution of this element, which takes place within already constituted technical
144:ensembles, does not provoke any upheaval: it improves the results of fabrication
144- without brutality, and authorizes the craftsman to preserve habitual methods,
144- while experiencing the feeling of facilitation at work; the habitual gestures, better

145-  necessarily through its size that the factory distinguishes itself from the craftsmans

145: the human being: the factory is a technical ensemble that is comprised of auto­
145-  matic machines, whose activity is parallel to that of human activity; the factory
145-  uses true technical individuals, whereas, in the workshop, it is man who lends his
145-  individuality to the accomplishment of technical actions. From then on the most

146- the nineteenth century can no longer be experienced by the individual, because
146- it is no longer centralized with the individual as the center of command and per­

146:organization of technical ensembles putting the machines to work. This is why
146- the notion of progress splits in two, becomes aggressive, ambivalent, and a source
146- of anxiety; progress is at a remove from man and no longer makes sense for the

147-    A third aspect of the notion of technical progress emerges with the repercussions
147:of the internal regulation of technical individuals regarding technical ensembles,
147- and, through these, regarding humanity. The second stage, that which corresponds
147- to the arrival of a new wave of technics at the level 0f individuals, was character­
147- ized by the ambivalence of progress, by dual situation of man with regard to the
147- machine, and by the production of alienation. This alienation grasped by Marxism

148- class. The relation of property with respect to the machine contains as much alien­
148- ation as the relation 0f non-property, even if it corresponds to a very different
148- social state. On either side of the machine, above and below, the worker, who is a
148:man of elements, and the industrial boss, who is a man of ensembles, both lack a
148- true relation with the individualized technical object in the form of the machine.
148- Labor and capital are two modes of being where one is as incomplete as the other
148- with respect to the technical object and the technicity contained in industrial orga­

148- dialectic), but rather with respect to the technical object; the same goes for labor;
148- what labor lacks is not what capital possesses, and what capital lacks is not what
148- labor possesses. Labor possesses the intelligence of elements, capital possesses the
148:intelligence 0f ensembles; but it is not by combining the intelligence of elements
148:with the intelligence of ensembles that one can arrive at the intelligence of the
148- interm ediary a n d non m ixed being that is the technical individual. Element, indi­
148:vidual, and ensemble follow each other along a temporal line; the man of the
148:element is late with respect to the individual; but the man of ensembles who has
148- not understood the individual is in no way ahead of his time with respect to it;
148:he tries to enclose the present technical individual in the structure of an ensemble
148- belonging to the past. Labor and capital are both late with respect to the technical
148- individual that is a depository of technicity. The technical individual is not of the
148- same era as the labor that enacts it and the capital that frames it.

149- Within man, what can be in a relation with the individualized technical being is
149- the intuition of the schemas of functioning; as a being who participates in its regu­
149- lation, man can be coupled to the machine as an equal, and not merely as a being
149:who directs or utilizes it through the incorporation of ensembles, or as a being who
149- serves it by supplying matter and elements. By this we mean to say that neither an
149- economic theory nor an energetic theory can account for such a coupling of man
149- and machine. Economic or energetic links are too external for it to be possible
149- to define this true coupling through them. There is an inter-individual coupling

151- of machines is that of the medium, whereas in human memory it is the plasticity
151- of the content itself.15 One can say that, in man, the function of preserving rec­
151:ollections resides in memory, because memory, conceived as a set [ensemble] of
151- forms, of schemas, receives the recollection it records because memory connects
151- the recollection with its forms; in a machine, on the contrary, recording occurs
151- without prior memory. From this essential difference comes human memory’s sig­

152- allows self-regulation; but human memory enables a self-regulation according to
152:an ensemble of significations valid in the living and capable of developing only in
152- the latter; that of the machine grounds a self-regulation that makes sense in the
152- world of non-living beings. The significations according to which human memory
152- functions stop where those according to which machine memory functions begin.
152-     The coupling of man to machine begins to exist from the very moment when a

153- automata lets us forget that these machines are precisely the ones that are most reli­
153- ant on man; while the other machines need man simply as a servant or organizer,
153- self-regulating machines need man as a technician, which is to say as an associate;
153- their relation to man is situated at the level of this regulation, not at the level of
153:elements or ensembles. But it is through this regulation that automatic machines
153:can be linked to the technical ensemble in which they function. Just as the human
153-  individual is not linked to the group by his elementary functions, whether active
153-  or perceptive, but by his self-regulation which gives him his personality and char­
153: acter, so the machine is integrated with the ensemble not only in an abstract and
153-  preliminary way, by its function, but also, at every moment, by the way it performs
153: its own task according to the requirements of the ensemble. Th ere is no such thing

154- as a purely internal, entirely isolated self-regulation; the results of the action are
154- not merely results in themselves but also in relation to their external milieu, to the
154:ensemble. Now this aspect of self- regulation in which the whole 0f the milieu must
154- be taken into account cannot be achieved by the machine alone, even if it is perfectly
154- automated. The type of memory and the type of perception needed for this aspect
154- of regulation call for the integration and transformation of the a posteriori into the
154- a p rio ri which only the living thing can achieve within itself. There is something
154:alive in a technical ensemble, and the integrative function of life can be ensured
154- only by human beings; the human being has the capacity to understand the func­
154- tioning of the machine, on the one hand, and the capacity to live, on the other: one
154- can speak 0f technical life as being that which actualizes this relation between these
154- two functions in man. Man is capable 0f taken upon himself the relation between

154- consists of the rhythm of the machines that surround him and that he connects
154- to one another. He fulfills the function of integration, and prolongs self-reg­
154- ulation beyond each monad of automatism through the interconnection and
154- inter-commutation of monads. The technician is indeed in a certain sense the
154:man of ensembles, but in a very different way from the one that characterizes
154- the industrialist. The industrialist, in the same way as the worker, is pushed by
154- finality: he targets a result; herein lies their alienation; the technician is the man
154- of the operation in the course of its accomplishment; he does not take charge of
154:directing the ensemble but rather guides its self- regulation during functioning. He
154- absorbs within himself the sense of the work and the sense of the industrial direc­
154- tion. He is the man who knows the internal schemas of functioning and organizes
154- them in relation to each other. On the contrary, machines are ignorant of general
154- solutions and cannot resolve general problems. Whenever it is possible to replace a

155- of numeration (rather than a decimal system) and reduce all operations to a series

155-     In this sense one can affirm that the birth 0f a technical philosophy at the level
155:of ensembles is possible only through an in- depth study of regulations, which is
155:to say of information. True technical ensembles are not the ones that use technical
155- individuals, but those that form a fabric of technical individuals through a rela­
155- tion of interconnection. Any philosophy of technics that starts from the reality
155:of ensembles using technical individuals without putting them into a relation of
155- information remains a philosophy of human power through technics, not a phi­
155- losophy of technics. One could use the term “autocratic philosophy of technics”
155:for a philosophy that takes the technical ensemble as a place where machines are
155- used in order to obtain power [puissance ]. The machine is only a means; the end
155- is the conquest of nature, the domestication 0f natural forces by means of a first
155- act of enslavement: the machine is .a slave whose purpose is to make other slaves.
155- Such a dominating and enslaving inspiration can coincide with the quest for mans

155- entire world is still to reign, and every reign presupposes the acceptance of the
155- schemas of enslavement.
155-     Technocratic philosophy itself is affected by an enslaving violence, insofar as it
155- is technocratic. A technicism that comes from a reflection on autocratic technical
155:ensembles is inspired by the unbridled will to conquer. It is immoderate, and lacks
155- internal control and self-mastery. It is a force that is unleashed and which can only
155- perpetuate itself for the duration of the ascending phase of success or conquest.

156- technocrats are essentially poly-technicians,18which is to say men who, with respect
156- to technics, find themselves in a situation of being intelligent users and organizers
156- of technics rather than veritable technicians. These mathematicians think in sets
156:[ensembles], not in individual operational units; what holds their attention is not so
156- much the machine as enterprise.

164- Information is thus halfway between pure chance and absolute regularity. One can
164- say that form, conceived as absolute spatial as well as temporal regularity, is not
164- information but a condition 0f information; it is what receives information, the
164- a p rio ri that receives information. Form has a function of selectivity. But informa­
164:tion is not form, nor is it a collection \ensemble ] of forms; it is the variability of
164- forms, the influx of variation with respect to a form. It is the unpredictability of a
164- variation of form, not pure unpredictability 0f all variation. We would thus be led
164- to distinguish three terms: pure chance, form, and information.

164- for another machine. Man understands machines; for there to be a true technical
164:ensemble man has to play a functional role between machines rather than above
164- them. It is man who discovers significations: signification is the meaning [sens] that

166- and can take into account what is happening outside the machine, in the technical
166:ensemble. The more automatized the machines are, the more restricted its possible
166- variations in speed are; they can thus go unperceived; but what is happening here

168- these two oscillators synchronize in such a way that one cannot say which one

168- different from the periods proper to each one of the oscillators.

171:    Technical ensembles are characterized by the fact that in them a relation between
171- technical objects takes shape at the level of the margin of indeterminacy of each

171-  only an individualized technical reality that is open according to two paths: that
171-  of the relation to elements, and that of the inter-individual relations within the
171: technical ensemble. The role culture has assigned to man alongside the machine

172- through the free plurality of its elements, or the open series of its possible relations
172:with other machines within the technical ensemble. Culture is unjust toward the
172- machine, not only in its judgments or its preconceptions, but at the very level of
172- knowledge: the cognitive intention of culture toward the machine is substantializ­

173:these conditions are realized in the technical ensembles employing machines that
173- have a sufficient degree of indeterminacy. For man, the action of having to inter­

173- independence in which he can acquire a cultural vision of technical realities. The
173- engagement in the asymmetrical relation with a single machine cannot provide the

182- degradation of the potential energies contained in a system through the passage to a
182- stable state from which transformation is no longer possible.
182-     The general hypothesis we are making about the sense of the coming-into-be-
182:ing of mans relation with the world consists in considering the whole [>l’ensemble]
182- formed by man and the world as a system. This hypothesis, however, is not lim­
182- ited to the affirmation that man and the world form a vital system, comprising
182- the living thing and its milieu; evolution could indeed be considered an adapta­
182- tion, i.e., a quest for a stable equilibrium of the system through a reduction of the

--

184- mans relation with the world, the other simultaneous and correlated aspect being
184- the institution of definite religions. However, coming-into-being does not stop at
184- the discovery 0f technicity: from being a solution, technicity once more becomes a
184- problem when it reconstitutes a system via an evolution that leads from technical
184:objects to technical ensembles: the technical universe is saturated then over- satu­
184- rated in turn, at the same time as the religious universe, just as had happened with
184- the magical universe. The inherence 0f technicity to technical objects is provisional;
184- it constitutes only a moment of genetic coming-into-being.

185:genesis of technicity, integrated into the ensemble of genetic processes that precede
185- it, follow and surround it, not only in order to be able to know technicity in itself,
185- but in order to grasp the problems that dominate the philosophical problematic at

189- and a technics) and exist at the same time, and they neither constitute a single
189- genetic lineage nor arise from the same sudden outpouring 0f the primitive magical
189- universe. True and balanced relations only exist between phases of the same level
189:(for example between a technical ensemble and a religion) or between successive
189- degrees of genesis that are part of the same lineage (for example between the stage
189- of technics and religions in the seventeenth century and the contemporary stages of
189:science and ethics). True relations only exist in a genetic ensemble balanced around
189- a neutral point, envisioned in its totality.
189-     This is precisely the goal to be attained: the mission of reflexive thought is to lift

201- it localizes and multiplies the mediation schemas, always remaining below unity.
201- The element, in technical thought, is more stable, better known, and in a certain
201:way more perfect than the ensemble; it is really an object, whereas the ensemble
201- always remains to a certain extent inherent in the world. Religious thought finds
201- the opposite balance: for religious thought, totality is that which is more stable,
201- stronger, and more valid than the element.

202- it in the form of results; it mediates and objectivizes the results of the action by
202- comparison with those 0f the technical operation, performing a decomposition
202- of the action into partial results, into elementary accomplishments. In the same
202- way that in the sciences, technicity introduces the search for a how through the
202:decomposition 0f an overall phenomenon {phénomène d ’ensemble] into elementary
202- operations, so too in ethics, technicity introduces the search for a decomposition
202- of a global action into elements of action; the total action being envisaged as that
202- which leads to a result, the decomposition of the action called for by technics con­
202- siders the elements of an action as movements obtaining partial results. Technicity
202- presupposes that an action is limited to its results; it is not concerned with the
202- subject of the action taken in its real totality, nor even with an action in its totality,
202- insofar as the totality 0f the action is founded on the unity of the subject. The con­
202- cern with the result in ethics is the analog of the search for a how in the sciences;
202:result and process remain below the unity of action or of the whole [ensemble] of
202- the real.
202-    The postulation of an absolute and unconditional justification that religion
202- directs at ethics translates into the search for intention, as opposed to the search for
202- the result that is inspired by technics. In the sciences, religious thought introduces

206- domain so as to evoke the completion of thought in other domains: a technical

211-     This is why the discovery of the beauty of technical objects cannot be left to per­

217-  need, nor experience are sufficient to explain appeal aspects: there exists a ‘silent’ (implicit) organization 0f the object that
217-  belongs to it just like its color or its shape, and which makes the appeal character inherent in it [...] In this way, Koffka
217: and Kurt Lewin abandon isomorphism: the system with a form is the whole [l ’ensemble] constituted by the subject and his
217: behavioral field, along with the entire network 0f forces connecting the sub- ensembles 0f the subject; there is no longer a
217-  physical field having its form, followed by a physiological field with own its form, and then finally psychological field having
217-  a third form, with these three independent forms being isomorphic among one another.” The forces at play in appeal aspects

224- domain, which is that of art; but art, 0f course, develops into a domain and has an
224- implicit internal finality: to preserve the transductive unity of a domain of reality
224- that tends to separate itself by way of specialization. Art is a deep reaction against
224:the loss of meaning and of the attachment to the whole [ensemble ] of being in its
224- destiny; it is not or must not be compensation, a reality occurring after the fact, but
224- on the contrary a primitive unity, a preface to a development according to unity;
224- art announces, prefigures, introduces, or completes, but it does not make real: it is
224- the deep and unitary inspiration that begins and consecrates.
224-    One could even ask oneself whether art, to the extent that it observes, is not also
224:what somehow sums up [résume] and renders an ensemble of realities transposable

242- their key-points: tools are free and abstract, always transportable everywhere one
242:goes, but technical ensembles are true networks concretely attached to the natural
242- world; a dam cannot be built just anywhere, nor can a solar furnace. Some notions
242- 0f traditional culture appear to suppose that the development of technics causes
242- the disappearance of the particular aspect of each place and region, leading to the
242- loss of customs and local artisanal inflections; in reality, technical development
242- creates a far more important and much more firmly rooted concretization than
242- the one it destroys; an artisanal custom, like a regional costume, can, by simple
242- influence, be transported from one place to another; it is only rooted in the human
242:world; conversely, a technical ensemble is profoundly rooted in the natural milieu.
242- There are no coal mines in primary terrains.
242-    So it is that some high points of the natural, technical, and human world are
242:constituted; it is the ensemble, the interconnection of these high points that makes
242- this polytechnic — both natural and human — universe; the structures of this
242- reticulation become social and political. In existence, technics are separate neither
242- for the natural world nor for the human world. And yet, for technical thought,
242- they remain as if they were separate due to the fact that no thought has been
242- sufficiently developed in order to allow for the theorization of this reticulation of
242:concrete technical ensembles. This theorization is the task that befalls philosophical
242- thought, for there is a new reality here that is not yet represented in culture. Beyond
242- the technical determinations and norms, one would have to discover polytechnic
242- and technological determinations and norms. A world of the plurality of technics
242- exists that has its own structures, and which ought to find representations within

--

242- that functionally attach them to the human world and to the natural world, as a
242- concrete mediation between these two worlds.
242-    The introduction of adequate representations of technical objects into culture
242- would result in the key-points of technical networks becoming real terms of ref­
242:erence for the ensemble of human groups, whereas they currently are only key
242- terms for those who understand them, which is to say for the technicians of each
242- specialty; for other men, they only have a practical value, and correspond to very
242:confused concepts; technical ensembles introduce themselves into the world as if
242- they had no natural or human right of belonging, while a mountain or promon­
242:tory, which have less concrete regulatory power than some technical ensembles, are
242- known by all men of a region and belong to the representation of the world.

243-    And yet, one can wonder to what extent the creation of a general technology
243- brings technics closer to religion; the recognition 0f the genuine [véritable ] com­
243:plex operational schemas and of the integration 0f technical ensembles would not
243- be enough to enable this rapprochement if there weren’t, along with a theoreti­
243- cal awareness of processes also a normative value contained in them. Indeed, the
243- reticular structures of integrated technics are no longer mere means available for
243- an action and abstractly transportable anywhere, utilizable at any moment; one
243- changes tools and instruments, one can construct or repair a tool oneself, but one
243- cannot change the network, one doesn’t construct a network of one’s own: one can
243- only connect to a network, adapt to it, participate in it; the network dominates
243- and frames [enserre] the action of the individual, it even dominates each technical
243:ensemble. Whence a form of participation in the natural world and in the human
243- world that gives an incorruptible collective normativity to technical activity; it is no
243- longer only a slightly abstract solidarity of trades as evoked by Sully Prudhomme
243- (the solidarity of specialists, the bricklayer, the baker), but an extremely concrete
243- and actual solidarity, existing instant by instant throughout the interplay of mul­
243- tiple conditionings; through the technical networks, the human world acquires a
243- high degree of internal resonance. The powers, forces, and potentials that drive
243- toward action exist in the reticular technical world in the same way in which they
243- might have existed in the primitive magical universe: technicity is a part of the
243:world, it is not only an ensemble of means, but an ensemble of conditionings of
243- action and of incitements to act; the tool or instrument doesn’t have normative
243- power because it is permanently available to the individual; technical networks take
243- on more normative power as the internal resonance of human activity throughout
243- technical realities becomes greater.
243:   However, the valorization of technical ensembles and their normative value
243- entail a very particular form of respect, which has in view pure technicity in itself.
243- It is this form of respect, founded on the knowledge of technical reality, and not
243- on the prestige of the imagination, which can penetrate culture. A large highway,
243- at the edge of a big city, imposes this form of respect; moreover, a harbor, the rail

245- state of technicity, what we mean to say is that the distribution and integration of
245- key-points of social and political thought in the world at least partially coincides
245- with the distribution and integration of the technical key-points, and that this
245- coinciding becomes all the more perfect as technics becomes increasingly inte­
245:grated within the universe, in the form of fixed ensembles, attached to one another,

246- of technics, but which translate the manner in which technics are used by human
246- groups; these modes of utilization of technics by human groups are themselves
246- subject to technics that no longer apply to the natural world, but rather to the
246:human world, and that don’t produce technical objects or technical ensembles,
246- unless one can consider the means of advertising or the retail organizations as such.
246- Currently, it could therefore be said that the agreement between technical thought
246- and non-technical thought is only possible at the price of very great simplification
246- and abstraction, as much in the technical domain as in the non-technical domain.

247- propaganda, just as a definite technics of human management leads to a social
247- and political option. But this encounter, this mutual complicity, can only exist at
247- the price of abandoning fidelity to the elementary functions, characterizing true
247- technicity, and the correlative abandonment 0f the mission to represent the func­
247:tions of totality characteristic of religious thought. The alliance 0f an ensemble of
247- procedures and of a mythology is not the encounter of technicity and of respect
247- with regard to totality.
247-    This is why philosophical thought must maintain the continuity that exists
247- between the successive stages of technical thought and religious thought, all the

247-    And yet, if the technics of man fail in their function of the analysis of elements,

247- they accept detaching themselves from the real object, the element, individual,

248- technics 0f the human world must have an objective material, they cannot be
248- purely psychological, lest they become procedures, in other words, it is by way of
248:an enlargement 0f technical ensembles comprising an integration into both the
248- natural world and the human world that one can subsequently act upon the human
248:world, that is, through, and according to, this natural and human ensemble: as
248- mediation between the natural world and the human world, technical thought can
248- act upon the human world only via the intermediary of this mediation. Human
248- reality can be the object of technics only when it is already engaged within a tech­
248- nical relation. There is no legitimate technics other than that of technical reality;

248- material; it is culture, considered as a lived totality, that must incorporate the tech­
248:nical ensembles by knowing their nature, in order to be able to regulate human life
248:according to these technical ensembles. Culture must remain above all technics,
248- but it must incorporate into its content the knowledge and intuition of genuine
248- technical schemas. Culture is that through which man regulates his relation with
248- the world and with himself; and yet if culture were not to incorporate technology,
248- it would contain an opaque zone and wouldn’t be able to contribute its regulative
248- normativity to the coupling of man and the world. For in this coupling of man
248:and the world, which is that of technical ensembles, there are schemas of activity
248- and conditioning that can be clearly thought only by virtue of concepts defined by
248- a reflexive but direct study. Culture must be contemporary with technics. Culture
248- must reshape itself [se reformer] and must once again take up its content stage by
248- stage. If culture is only traditional, then it is false, because it implicitly and spon­

249- founded on the normative notion of utility that is at once valorizing and devaluing.
249- But this notion of utensil and of utility is inadequate to the effective and actual
249:role of technical ensembles within the human world; it thus cannot be regulative
249- in an effective way.
249-    Deprived of the contribution of cultural regulation, which passes through the
249- intermediary of an adequate representation 0f technical realities, this coupling of
249- man and the world develops in isolation, in a non-integrated, anomical manner.

--

249- Nothing effectively proves that technical reality can be adequately known through
249- concepts; conceptual knowledge can indeed designate and cover technical real­
249- ity at the level of separate technical objects, which can be classified according to
249- structures and usages. But only with great difficulty can it lead into knowledge of
249:technical ensembles. To acquire this knowledge, the human being must really be
249- put into a situation, since it is a mode of existence that he must experience. The
249- tool, instrument, or isolated machine can be perceived by a subject who remains
249:detached from them. But the technical ensemble cannot be grasped by intuition,
249- for it cannot be considered a detached, abstract, or m anipulate object at man’s
249- disposal. It corresponds to an experience 0f existence [épreuve] and a situation, it is
249- tied by reciprocal action with the subject.
249-    In the same way one used to consider journeys as a means for acquiring culture,
249- because they constituted a mode of placing man into a situation, one should also
249- consider the technical experiences of being placed into a situation with respect
249:to an ensemble, with effective responsibility, as having cultural value. To put it
249- another way, every human being should to a certain extent take part in technical
249:ensembles, that is, take on a responsibility, a definite task with respect to such an
249:ensemble and be connected with a network of universal technics. Furthermore,
249:individual man should not simply experience a single kind of technical ensemble,
249- but rather a plurality of them, just as a traveler will have to encounter several peo­
249- ples, and experience their mores.
249-    However, this kind of experience must be conceived more as a way of experi­
249:encing the situating of each type of technics and ensemble of technics, than as an
249- effort to participate in the condition of man in each of the technics: for in each

--

250- in the different technics. It is the particular situating in the technical network that
250- must be experienced, insofar as it places man in the presence of and within a series
250- 0f actions and processes that he does not direct alone, but in which he participates.
250-     The philosopher, comparable in this role to the artist, can help in raising aware­
250:ness 0f the situation within the technical ensemble, by reflecting it within himself
250- and by expressing it; but, again just as the artist, all he can do is be the one who
250- solicits an intuition in others, once a definite sensitivity has been awakened and
250- allows the grasping of the sense 0f a real experience.
250-     However, we must note that art, as a means of expression and as awakening of
250:the cultural awareness of technical ensembles, is limited; art goes through aïo0r|Gtç
250- [afsthësis] and is therefore naturally inclined to grasp the object, tool, instrument,
250- or machine; but true technicity, that which can be integrated into culture, is not
250- in the manifest. All the prestigious color photographs of sparks, of fumes, all the
250- recordings of noise, sounds, or images, generally remain a use [exploitation] of tech­
250- nical reality and not a revelation of this reality. Technical reality must be thought,
250- and even be known through participation in its schemas of action; aesthetic feeling
250- can emerge, but only after this intervention of real intuition and participation and
250- not as a fruit of a mere spectacle: every technical spectacle remains puerile and
250:incomplete if it is not preceded by the integration into the technical ensemble.
250-     The intuitions of technical participation, however, are not opposed to the forces
250- and qualities of religious and social and political thought. Social and political
250- thought is continuous with respect to religious thought when it is not an actual
250- and already realized totality properly speaking (for totality is what it is, it is an
250- absolute and cannot push toward action), but instead is the latency of broader
250:ensembles undergirding actual structures, and the validity of this announcement
250- of new structures; social and political thought expresses the relation of totality with
250- respect to the part, of virtual totality with respect to the actual part. It expresses
250- the function of relative totality, whereas religions express the function of absolute
250- totality, and it expresses the function of virtual totality, whereas religions express
250- the function of actual totality. And yet, there can be a complementary relation
250:between the intuitions of integration into technical ensembles and social and polit­
250- ical intuitions, because technical intuitions express the result of history and of the
250- conditioning of life, of the hic et nunc , whereas the social and political intuitions
250- are a project going toward the future, the active expression of potentials. Social
250- and political thoughts are the expression of tendencies and forces that exceed all

251:actual given structure; the intuitions relating to technical ensembles express what
251- humanity has done, what is done, and what is structured because done, accom­
251- plished. Figurai power can thus remain invested in technics and ground power in
251- social and political thought, insofar as figurai reality is what is given in the system
251- of actuality whereas ground power contains potentials and keeps the becoming in
251- reserve. While impossible at the level of the relation between elementary technical
251- objectivity and universal religious thought, the relation once more becomes possi­
251:ble when it establishes itself between technical ensembles, which is the expression
251- of actuality, and social and political thought, which is the expression of virtuality.
251- There is a compatibility between actuality and virtuality through the real com-
251- ing-into-being, whose meaning [sens] is stretched taught between this actuality and
251- this virtuality. Philosophical thought grasps the correlation between actuality and
251- virtuality, and it maintains it by establishing the coherence 0f this relation.
251-    It is thus the sense [sens] of coming-into-being, the ability of technics to engen­
251- der the coming-into-being of both the natural and the human world, that makes
251:elementary intuition and the intuition of the ensemble compatible; technical
251:intuition, at the level of ensembles, expresses coming- into-being as both basis and
251- result obtained; social and political intuition is the integration of tendencies, the
251- expression of virtualités and forces 0f coming-into-being, in the same reality. At
251- the level of technical thought attached to tools, and of universalizing religious
251- thought, there cannot be any direct encounter between the two types of thought,
251- because the mediation of coming-into-being is not possible; each tool, each sep­
251- arate technics that is capable 0f manipulating tools present themselves as stable
251- and definitive. Universalizing religious thought also presents itself as stable and
251- definitive, with reference to an atemporal ground. Conversely, the introduction of
251:technicity to ensembles which situate man as organizer or as element makes tech­
251- nics evolve; to the same extent and at the same time, the evolving aspect of human
251- groups becomes conscious and this consciousness creates socio-political thought.
251- Both born from coming-into-being, one expressing the definite past serving as its
251- basis and the other the possible future serving as its goal, the technical thought of
251:ensembles and social and political thought are coupled through their conditions of
251- origin and their points of integration into the world.
251-     Thus it is within the perspective of permanent change within technical and
251- socio-political structures that technical thought and socio-political thought can
251- coincide. Elementary technicity, the one that animates the thought 0f artisans, and

252:technical ensembles and for thinking the coming- into-being of totalities; without
252- the norm of elementary technics and that of universal religiosity, the technical
252:thought 0f ensembles in a process of coming- into-being and the social and political
252- thought of evolving communities would lose their reciprocal tension; the thought
252:of technical ensembles needs to be inspired by that of elements, and that of the
252- coming-into-being of the human world by the function of totality, in order for
252- these two forms of thought, which must meet analogically but which must not be
252- confused with each other, to preserve their autonomy and not enslave one another.
252- Because the functional totality of thought coming from the primitive relation with
252- the world must be maintained by the real bipolarity of the primitive phase shift’s
252- results; culture is directed by this bipolarity; it develops between technical thought
252- and religious thought; it is culture that links the lived understanding [<compréhen­
252:sion] of the technicity of ensembles with that 0f the human groups represented in
252- socio-political thought.
252-    The past — i.e., the first forms of technical thought and of religious thought, at
252- the level of the first splitting in two 0f magical thought, as well as aesthetic activity
252- placed at the neutral point 0f this first split — must be preserved as cultural con­
252- tent, i.e., as a foundation for providing the norms for current thought, but it is only
252- as cultural content that they must be preserved; it would be a transgression \faute]
252- against coming-into-being to want to substitute the representation of elements,
252:tools or instruments for that of the current technicity of ensembles; for technicity,
252- in its current lived reality, no longer simply resides at the level of elements, but
252:also and essentially at the level of ensembles; today ensembles are depositaries of
252- technicity in the same way that the fragmentation into elements had been prior to
252- this; thought must start from the knowledge of the technicity of elements, re-sit-
252:uated in the past, in order to grasp the technicity of ensembles in their reality, for
252- it effectively results from it: thought must go from the cultural to the actual in
252- order to understand the actual in its reality. Furthermore, religious thought is a
252- permanent reminder of the sense 0f totality, and culture must renew the rootedness
252- of socio-political thought in universalized religious thought, proceeding from the

253- nical objects, on the basis of a general normalization 0f the common vocabulary
253- and notions, replacing the false specificity of trade terms, caused by use and not
253- by the essence proper to the elements; technology is that on the basis of which
253- the plurality of technical objects, which is the depositary of primitive technics,
253:serves as the basis for the constitution 0f technical ensembles. Ecumenism is that
253- on the basis of which the universalizing unicity of religious thought, which is the
253- depositary of the function of primitive totality, serves as a basis for socio-political
253- thought. Technology accomplishes, on the basis of plurality, a conversion toward
253- unity, whereas ecumenism, first of all grasping unity, accomplishes or allows for the

254- elements taken one by one, in their combination, and of their mutual relations
254:that are constitutive of the ensemble; the real to be known resides at the end of the
254- effort for knowledge, it is not a mass given all at once in its totality; made of ele­
254- ments because it is knowable as a combination of elements, this reality is essentially
254- an object. Conversely, being the paradigm of deductive thought, religious thought

255- operational knowledge it is still object, in the first sense of “that which is placed in
255- front,” as a piece of wood is placed on a workbench, waiting for its incorporation

255- the real does not precede the operation of knowledge; it comes after it. Even if it
255- appears to precede it according to common experience, it succeeds it according to
255- real knowledge, since this knowledge only grasps the real when it has reconstructed

256- idea, or on the basis 0f elements and by combination, like the concept, but rather
256:grasps being at the level 0f domains constituting a structured ensemble. Intuition
256- is neither sensible nor intellectual; it is the analogy between the coming-into-being
256- of known being and the coming-into-being of the subject, the coincidence of two
256- comings-into-being: intuition is not merely the grasping of figurai realities, like the
256- concept, nor a reference to the totality of the ground of the real taken in its unity,

257:Intuition intervenes as mediator, considering ensembles in which there is genesis of
257- structure, i.e., genesis of a correlation between figure and ground. Intuition is thus
257- a particular procedure of philosophical knowledge, because by virtue of it thought
257- can grasp being in its essence, which is the formula 0f its genetic coming-into-
257- being, and remain at the neutral point 0f this coming-into-being in order to ensure

258- power of structuration, as a capacity for the invention of the structures that resolve
258- problems 0f coming-into-being, at the level of this intermediary nature between
258- the plurality and totality that is the reticular diversity of the domains of existence.
258-    Intuition recovers the figurai aspect and the ground aspect by in a real unity;
258:for the elements and totality are not the concrete whole [ensemble] of being; the
258- unity 0f being is the active center on the basis of which exist, through a split, figure
258- and ground, i.e., the elements on the one hand and totality on the other; intuition
258- knows and fulfills this unity of being, which is the combination of elements and
258- totality; intuition is the relation 0f figure and ground in itself; it is not, like the
258- idea, co-natural with the being it grasps, for this co-naturalness can grasp only
258:the ground, which is not the whole [ensemble] of being, it is not abstract like the
258- concept, which abandons the concreteness 0f being in order to preserve only the
258- definite figure. Grasping the primitive relation of figure and ground, intuition is
258- analogical with respect to being; it is a knowledge that justifies neither full realism
258- nor pure nominalism, but a stable mixture of these two ways of envisioning knowl­

259- task; the real unity is that of the task rather than that of the tool, but the task
259- cannot be objectivated and can only be lived, experienced, accomplished, and not
259- strictly speaking, reflected upon [réfléchie]. At the second level, technical objects
259:are part of technical ensembles. Consequently, at the first level or at the second
259- level, technical objects cannot be considered as absolute realities and as existing by
259- themselves, even after having been constructed. Their technicity can be understood
259- only through the integration of the activity of a human user or the functioning of a
259:technical ensemble. It would thus not be legitimate to seek to understand the tech­
259- nicity of an object on the basis of an induction comparable to that which one can
259- apply to natural beings; the technical object, which never harbors all of technicity
259:on its own, either because it is a tool or because it is the element in an ensemble,
259- must be known by philosophical thought, i.e., by a thought that has the intuition
259- of the coming-into-being of the modes of relation between man and the world.
259-    The use of this genetic method defines the technical object through reference
259:to the technicity of the artisanal operation or the technical ensemble, and not the
259:technicity of the operation or that of the ensemble on the basis of some property
259- of the object that technicity would be. This functional aspect, however, and this
259- conditioning of the technical objects genesis are indeed effectively translated by
259- a particular type of the technical objects coming-into-being, what we have called
259- the concretization of the technical object. The process of this concretization can

263- nical operation and the functioning of this operation; this operation prolongs the
263- technical functioning just as the functioning anticipates this operation: the func­
263- tioning is an operation and the operation a functioning. One cannot speak of the
263:work of a machine, but only of its functioning, which is an ordered ensemble of
263- operations. Form and matter, if they still exist, are at the same level and belong to
263- the same system; there is continuity between the technical and the natural.

266- it is a mental operation, a mental functioning that is of the same order as scientific
266- knowledge. There is an equality of levels between science and technical invention;
266- the mental schema is what enables invention and science; it is the mental schema,
266- once more, that allows the use 0f the technical object as productive, in an industrial
266:ensemble, or as scientific, in an experimental setup. Technical thought is present in
266- all technical activity, and technical thought is of the order of invention; it can be
266- communicated; it authorizes participation.

271- runs the risk of not being very effective unless it goes as far as the very foundation
271- of the communication between man and machine. In order for information to
271- be exchanged, man must possess within himself a technical culture, which is to
271:say an ensemble of forms that, upon encountering the forms contributed by the
271- machine, will be able to elicit meaning [signification]. The machine remains one 271- of the obscure zones of our civilization, at all social levels. This alienation exists as

271- technics through technical activity, not via the values of work or economic criteria;
271- social conditions and economic factors cannot be harmonized because they are
271:parts of different ensembles; they can only find mediation within a predominantly
271- technical organization. This level of technical organization where man encounters
271- man not as the member of a class but as a being who expresses himself within the
271- technical object which is homogeneous with respect to his activity, is the level of
271- the collective, going beyond the inter-individual and the given social.

272- essentially technical. The organization of channels of information in a company
272- must follow the lines of technical operation and not that of social hierarchy or of
272- purely inter-individual relations, which are inessential with respect to technical
272:operation. The company, being the ensemble of technical objects and men, must
272- be organized on the basis 0f its essential function, that is its technical function­
272:ing; it is at the level 0f the technical operation that the whole [ensemble] of the
272- organization can be thought, not as a confrontation of classes, i.e., as a pure social
272:ensemble, or as a grouping of individuals each having their psyche, which brings
272:the ensemble down to an inter- psychological schema, but as a unit [une unité\ of
272- technical functioning. The technical world is a world of the collective, which is
272- adequately thought neither on the basis of the brute social [fact], nor on the basis
272- of the psyche. To consider technical activity as inessential in its very structure,

277- because it delivers only one 0f the two pulses it receives, this pulse in turn is capable
277:of activating another ensemble of triodes; it therefore realizes through its physical
277- functioning the analog of the mental operation of addition. To establish a chain
