Lets try and situate ourselves in a spot we'll need to try and describe in tandem with others. Surprising association of verbs: *to subsist, to make a group, to be on a particular patch of soil, to describe oneself*. 70

Being tracked is not the same things as *situating oneself*. 72

avoid knocking over the theodolites of the engineer-surveyors 71

On the one hand, we identify a place by locating it at the intersection of coordinates through the movements of a sort of chain of surveyors; on the other, we learn to *list attachments* to entities that force us to take care of them. 72

we call local what is *discussed and argued in common' 74
