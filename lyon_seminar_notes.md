- Sverre intro
    - from Orwell to click on Facebook
    - transformative
    - what is culture?
    - how can we study?
    - migrant workers in Laos; migrant unions; being watched is a form of political power, given the number of followers; 

- what happens to culture?
    - what about operational events? 
    - what about Macey conference? quantification won out; what happened to meaning? Donald Mackay?

- tonya:
    - surveillance imaginaries - ubiquity is part of them; not real?
    - children - what is not seen? What are they doing?

- ashlin
    - how logjects allow play to normalize;
    - public service - risk aversion; outsourcing;  
    - where do we understand data supply chains fitting in?
    - points of novelty in the data supply chain?
    - 2 provocations:
        - if normalizing is happening, what do we do about it? 
        - where we go next: biosensors for internal body states? For environment?  Kevin Haggerty; Dan Trottier;  
        - zuboff on neuroscience and  Facebook
- terhi Nurmikko-Fuller
    - privacy increased as our sense of agency lost
    - gaming;  
    - celebrity; 
    - need for interdisciplinarity
    - convenience as key?

- susan halford
    - links between critical data studies and surveillance
    - how computational methods could be done differently? foundation for hope
    - user-generated surveillance; by watching we generate data;
    - quite a performative account; 'computers on their own do nothing';
    - agency? we could challenge the inevitability; imaginaries of alternatives;  possibilities: visibility & recognition, and concern for others at a distance;  
    - utopias as method; sociology don't do future enough; future talk capacity is power; see Appadurai's work on move from probability to possibility.  
    - deepen the future (Levitas); alliance across and outside the academy (govt, industry, third sector); democratise the future; intervene in the future using a multi-pronged strategy.   
    
- david lyon
    - bad news, more bad news, etc.; what people actually do with the news; same with memes;  
    - democratising the future; ask what is it for? not just efficiency, speed,  
    - e.g. collaborate with Blackberry founder; founded centre on data governance;
