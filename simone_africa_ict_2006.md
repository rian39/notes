Many cities embody a very different kind of virtuality. Their progressive impoverishment and deindustrializatin, coupled with the enormous demands made on urban space, engenders a reliance on the sheer density of inhabitants, actions and possibilities for association to produce an urban life falling largely outside of any available conceptual language to understand it or governance frameworks to regulate it. Although these cities are in reality no less connected to a larger urban world, they convey the sense of being off the map, marginalized from the “real” global urban world. 133-134

As urban Africa experiences even more inexplicable rhythms of sudden accumulation and loss, the mechanics through which wealth is produced appear to residents as something increasingly occluded, and thus accountable only in terms of ephemeral events and forces. 136-7
Instead of the rapidly expanding increase in the volume of cell phone and Internet use being put to work as instruments to tracking transactions with greater scope, rapidity, and accountability, these tools are being engaged as means to intensify dissimulation. 151
Disillusionment with urban modernity also reinforces a retreat into what might be viewed as highly “rural” patterns of subsistence: the return to primary agricultural production, the pooling of available assets, and the reorganization of households into interweavings of extended kin and associates all involved in discrete yet complementary economic activities that provide a hedge against seasonal and sectoral declines in any one specific kind of activity. 153
Because individuals find that their participation in any one network produces only limited gains, their participation moves elsewhere. A rippling effect takes hold that extends the reach of actors into a broader circuit of potential exchanges. At the same time, it dissipates any concentrated mobilization of collective force. The practices become the conventional  way of operating in the city and, thus, shape the spatiotemporal parameters of everyday urban life. 154

Urban Africans have continuously been involved in remaking their cities in ways that enable them to use the shifting agglomeration of different bodies, stories, and spaces as a means of livelihood. In this way, urban life has a sense of home-grown virtuality. This virtuality is being combined with the virtual environment opened up by ICTs. 155
