By this word governmentality I mean three things. First, by governmentality I understand the ensemble formed by institutions, procedures, analyses and reflections, calculations, and tactics that allow the exercise of this very specific, albeit very complex, power that has the population as its target, political economy as its major form of knowledge, and apparatuses of security as its essential technical instrument. Second, by governmentality I understand the tendency, the line of force, that for a long time, and throughout the West, has constantly led towards the pre-eminence over all other types of power -- sovereignty, discipline, and so on -- of the type of power that we can call government and which has led to the development of a series of specific governmental apparatuses ( appareils ) on the one hand, [and, on the other] to the development of a series of knowledges ( savoirs ). Finally, by governmentality I think we should understand the process, or rather, the result of the process by which the state of justice of the Middle Ages became the administrative state in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and was gradually governmentalized. 108-109
