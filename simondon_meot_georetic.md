milieu, for which the factory with its polyphase grid and constant frequency is an
example. The example of the traction motor allows us to grasp the existence of a
twofold relation that the technical object entertains, with its geographical milieu
on the one hand, and its technical milieu on the other.
    The technical object is situated at the meeting point between two milieus, and
--
through turns, and on slopes, while maintaining its speed as constant as possible.
The traction motor not only transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy;
it applies it to a varied geographical world, which translates technically into the
shape of the tracks, the variable resistance of the wind, the resistance of snow that
 the front of the locomotive pushes out of the way. The traction motors reaction
 rebounds on the line that feeds it, creating a reaction that is the translation of
 this geographical and meteorological structure of the world: the absorbed intensity
 increases and the voltage in the line decreases when the snow thickens, when the
 slope rises, when lateral wind pushes the wheels’ guards against the tracks and
--
increases friction. The two w orlds a c t upon each other v iz the traction motor. A three-
phase factory motor, on the contrary, does not establish a reciprocal relation of
causality between the technical world and the geographical world in the same way;
its operation takes place almost entirely within the technical world. The uniqueness
o f this milieu explains why there is no need for an adaptation milieu in the case of
--
of both the weight and volume o f traction motors even while it increases their
efficiency; such modifications tend toward a function of mediation between the
technical and geographical worlds, since a locomotive can now have a lower center
of gravity, with its motors often located at the level of the bogies; the inertia of the
rotor is reduced, which is desirable for the sake of rapid braking. The use of silicon
--
use extends itself; (a small version of) this type of improved motor can be used as a
truck speed-reducer; the motor is in fact adapted to the relational modality as such
and not only to this precise type of relation that links the grid and the geographical
world for the purpose of the trains traction.

physically situated in such a way that it realizes the thermal exchanges that allow
for a reduction of its size. One could say that a concretizing invention realizes a
techno-geographic milieu (in this case the oil and water in turbulence), which in
turn is a condition o f possibility o f the technical object’s functioning. The technical
object is thus its own condition, as a condition o f existence o f this m ixed m ilieu which
is simultaneously both technical and geographical. This phenomenon of self­
conditioning defines the principle according to which the development of technical
objects is made possible without a tendency toward hypertely and then mal-
--
of a fatal hypertely. For this to be possible, the evolution of technical objects must
be constructive, which is to say that it calls forth the creation of this third tech-
no-geographic milieu wherein each modification is self-conditioned. Indeed, this is
not about a form o f progress conceived as a march in a direction fixed in advance,
nor about a humanization of nature; this progress could just as well present itself
as a naturalization of man; between man and nature a techno-geographical milieu
arises that only becomes possible through man’s intelligence: the self-conditioning
o f a schema as a result of its functioning necessarily requires the use of an inventive
--
a new organ appears in the evolving series, it maintains itself only if it realizes a
systematic and pluri-functional convergence. The organ is its own condition. It is
in a similar manner that the geographical world and the world of already existing

--
technical life through a law o f serrated evolution.
    Nowhere else does such a rhythm of relaxation find its equivalent; neither the
human nor the geographical world can produce such oscillations of relaxation,
with successive fits and spurts o f new structures. This relaxation time is the tech­
nical time properly speaking; it can become dominant with respect to all other
--
and its milieu could take place in a continuous time and a continuous space, with­
out any privileged moment or place. In fact, preceding the segregation of units,
a reticulation of space and time that highlights privileged places and moments
institutes itself, as if all of mans power to act and all the world s ability to influence
man were concentrated in these places and in these moments. These places and
--
the appearance of a figure and a ground in this mode of existence, is the one that
gives rise to the magical universe. The magical universe is structured according to
the most primitive and meaningful of organizations: that of the reticulation of the
world into privileged places and privileged moments. A privileged place, a place
that has a power, is one that drains from within itself all the force and efficacy of
--

    And magical thought comes first, since it corresponds to the simplest and most
concrete, the most vast and flexible structuration: that o f reticulation. Within the
totality constituted by man and the world a network o f privileged points actualiz­
ing the insertion of human effort appears as an initial structure, and through which
--
relation to the continuous ground.
   The figurai structure, in primitive magical thought, is inherent to the world, it is
not detached from it; it is the reticulation of the universe into privileged key-points

--

through which the exchanges between the living thing and its milieu come to
pass. Now, it is precisely this reticular structure that is phase-shifted when one
passes from the original magical unity to technics or religion: figure and ground
separate by detaching themselves from the universe to which they adhered; the
--
in any moment whatsoever: as a figure, the key-points, detached from the ground
whose key they were, become technical objects, transportable and abstracted from
the milieu. At the same time, the key-points lose their mutual reticulation and
their power of influence from a distance on the reality that surrounded them; as
technical objects they have action only through contact, point by point, instant by
--
tools and instruments, the ground powers subjectivize themselves by personifying
themselves in the form of the divine and the sacred (God, heroes, priests).
    The primitive reticulation of the magical world is thus the source o f opposing
objectivation and subjectivation; at the moment of rupture o f the initial struc­
turation, the fact that the figure detaches itself from the ground is translated by
--
rather than limited by the basic conditions of technics and religion.
   The origin of the split that has given rise to technical thought and religious
thought can be attributed to a truly functional primitive structure of reticulation.
This split has separated figure and ground, the figure giving the content of tech­
nics, and the ground that of religion. While, in the magical reticulation of the
world, figure and ground are reciprocal realities, technics and religion appear when
figure and ground detach themselves from one another, thereby becoming mobile,
--
which makes up the efficacy of action on the singular points; these singular points,
detached from the world whose figure they were, also detached from one another,
losing their immobilizing reticular concatenation, become capable of being frag­
mented and available, as well as reproducible and constructible. The elevated place
becomes an observation post, a watchtower built on the plain, or a tower placed at
--

Technical thought — resulting from the rupture in the primitive structure of the
magical world's reticulation, and retaining the figurai elements that can be depos­
ited in objects, tools, or instruments — gains an availability from this detachment
that enables it to apply itself to every element of the world. However, this rupture
--
be without continuity with the other grounds: a universe is what is structured in
this way, and not a set [ensemble] of individuals; after the rupture of the primitive
reticulation the first detached beings to appear are technical objects and religious

--
   Technicity and religiosity are not degraded forms of magic, or relics of magic;
they come from the splitting in two of the primitive magical complex, the origi­
nal reticulation o f the human milieu, into figure and ground. It is through their
coupling, and not in and o f themselves, that technics and religion are the heirs of
magic. Religion is not more magical than technics; it is the subjective phase of the
--
recovers — on the basis o f a given situation, and according to an analogical struc­
tural and qualitative relation — a universalizing continuity with respect to other
situations and to other possible realities. The work of art re-establishes a reticular
universe at least for perception. But the work of art doesn’t really reconstruct the
primitive magical universe: this aesthetic universe is partial, integrated, and con­
--
tence, both objective and subjective, as an outstanding point. Any act, any thing,
any moment has in itself the ability to become an outstanding point of a new
reticulation of the universe. Every culture selects the acts and situations that are
apt to become outstanding points; but culture is not what creates the aptitude of
a situation to become an outstanding point; it only forms a barrage against certain
--
   The destiny of aesthetic thought, or more precisely of the aesthetic inspiration
of all thought tending toward its own completion, is to reconstitute, within each
mode of thinking, a reticulation that coincides with the reticulation o f other modes
of thinking: the aesthetic tendency is the ecumenism of thought. In this sense,
beyond even the maturity of each of the genera o f thought, there occurs a final
reticulation that once again brings the separate types of thought which emerged
from the shattering of primitive magic closer together. The first stage of each type
of thought’s development is isolation, non-adherence to the world, abstraction.
--
what is not itself and behaved as a species, after having affirmed itself according to
the unconditional monism of principles, pluralizes itself and widens according to
a principle of plurality; one could say that each thought tends to become reticular
and once more to adhere to the world after having distanced itself from it. After
having mobilized and detached the schematic figures of the magical world from

 re-incorporation into the world, the geographical world for technics, the human
world for religions.
    To this day, it does not appear possible for the two reticulations, that of tech­
nics within the geographical world and that of religions in the human world, to
analogically encounter each other in a real, symbolic relation. And yet only in
this way could the aesthetic impression state the rediscovery of the magical total­
--
tribution at the level prior to the distinction of these modalities. What is broken in
the move from magic to technics and religion, is the first structure of the universe,
in other words the reticulation o f key-points, which is the direct mediation between
man and the world. And aesthetic activity preserves precisely this structure of retic­
ulation. It cannot really preserve it in the world, since it cannot substitute itself
--
in the wind and on the sea that is beautiful, like the statue on the promontory. The
lighthouse by the reef dominating the sea is beautiful, because it is integrated as a
key-point of the geographical and human world. A line of pylons supporting the
cables that traverse a valley is beautiful, whereas the pylons, seen on the trucks that
bring them, or the cables, on the big rolls that serve to transport them, are neutral.
--
equally beautiful when they become integrated within the human world and cover
it over in expressing it; if the alignment of boards in a telephone center is beauti­
ful, then it is not beautiful in itself or in its relation with the geographical world,
since it can be anywhere; it is beautiful because these luminous flashes that trace
the multi-colored and moving constellations represent instant by instant the real
--
and without qualities; by virtue of aesthetic activity, this neutral zone recovers a
density and signification, while staying central and balanced; via aesthetic works,
it recovers the reticular structure that stretched across the whole of the universe
before the dissociation of magical thought.
   While technical thought is made up of schemas, of figurai elements without
--
qualities. Instead of representing elementary functions, like technical thought, or
the functions of totality, like religious thought, it holds elements and totality, as
well as figure and ground by way of analogical relation; the aesthetic reticulation of
the world is a network of analogies.
   The aesthetic work is, in fact, linked not only to the world and to man, as a
--
functionally be a memory and a re-enacting of magic; it is a magic going backward,
a magic in reverse; whereas the initial magic is that through which the universe
reticulates into singular points and singular moments, art is that through which a
new reticulation emerges from out o f science, morals, mysticism, and ritual and as
a consequence o f this new reticulation, there is the emergence of a real universe, in
which the effort, which had been separated from itself, and which arose from the
internal disjunction that technics and religion underwent, comes to completion,
--
ment of a mode within itself; this is how art is magical: it aims at finding modes
without going outside a mode, only by dilating it, reworking it, and perfecting
it. There is magic because there is a supposition of a reticular structure of the real
universe; each mode magically exceeds itself while staying objectively within itself.
This presupposes that the other modes are also subject to the same internal quest: it
--
in space and in time, is nevertheless a networked reality: this point is homologous
to an infinity of others that echo it and that are this point as well, however without
negating the ecceity [eccéite] of each node o f the network: here, in this reticular
structure of the real, resides what one can call aesthetic mystery.

--
sure, then the function of the respect of totality that it represents would never be
challenged; but other dimensions of totality emerge besides those coming from
 the reticulation of primitive magic; the individual tendencies, and above all the
social groupings that develop and structure themselves over time have powers of
 totality that cannot be mediated. Each city brings its own vision of the world, its
--
ing of technics and of the thinking of totalities, the matrix of religions, because
these two types o f thought apply to the mediation, not only between the world and
individual man, but between the geographical world and the human world; these
two types of thought have human reality as their object, and elaborate themselves
on the basis o f this new weight; they refract human reality into different direc­
--
 technics and religions were able to develop by taking advantage of the dissocia­
 tion of the primitive magical universe considered almost exclusively as the natural
 world; the human world remained enveloped by the primitive magical reticula­
 tion. Conversely, from the moment at which the man’s technics broke away from
 this reticulation, and began considering man as technical matter, what emerged

--
replaced by a network of analogically connected units.
   The condition for this discovery is a deepening of the sense of technics and of
the sense of religion that would lead to a reticular structuration of technics and
religion. Technics and religion can coincide, not in the continuity of their content,
but through a certain number of singular points belonging to both areas, and by
--
constituted; it is the ensemble, the interconnection of these high points that makes
this polytechnic — both natural and human — universe; the structures of this
reticulation become social and political. In existence, technics are separate neither
for the natural world nor for the human world. And yet, for technical thought,
they remain as if they were separate due to the fact that no thought has been
sufficiently developed in order to allow for the theorization of this reticulation of
concrete technical ensembles. This theorization is the task that befalls philosophical
thought, for there is a new reality here that is not yet represented in culture. Beyond
--
be enough to enable this rapprochement if there weren’t, along with a theoreti­
cal awareness of processes also a normative value contained in them. Indeed, the
reticular structures of integrated technics are no longer mere means available for
an action and abstractly transportable anywhere, utilizable at any moment; one
changes tools and instruments, one can construct or repair a tool oneself, but one
--
tiple conditionings; through the technical networks, the human world acquires a
high degree of internal resonance. The powers, forces, and potentials that drive
toward action exist in the reticular technical world in the same way in which they
might have existed in the primitive magical universe: technicity is a part of the
world, it is not only an ensemble of means, but an ensemble of conditionings of
--
the hic et nunc, social and political thought, nevertheless, accepts positing current
and concrete problems; in the same way as technical thought being developed
does, social and political thought leads to a reticular representation of the world,
with key-points and essential moments; it applies to technical reality by treating

--

it as more than a simple means, and indeed grasps technical reality at the level of
the reticulation of integration into the natural and human world. Three important
recent social and political doctrines have thus incorporated, each in an original
way, a representation and valorization o f integrated technics; National Socialist
--
of unity are necessary as a basis, so that mediation, at the level of this encounter
between the status of plurality and the status of superiority with respect to unity
that is realized by the structure of reticulation, can be possible at the neutral point
of the coming-into-being of thought.
    However, in order for philosophical thought to be able to perform the integra­
--
effectively a relation with the real that is both theoretical and practical; it knows
and acts on it, because it grasps it in the moment in which it comes-into being;
philosophical thought is thus philosophical gesture inserting itself into the reticular
figure-ground structure that determines itself in being; philosophy intervenes as a
power of structuration, as a capacity for the invention of the structures that resolve
problems o f coming-into-being, at the level of this intermediary nature between
the plurality and totality that is the reticular diversity of the domains of existence.
   Intuition recovers the figurai aspect and the ground aspect by in a real unity;
for the elements and totality are not the concrete whole [ensemble] of being; the
