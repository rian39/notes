Rather than positing that objects simply have normative capacities (or not), we must investigate how they become invested with specific normative powers through the deployment of particular settings and devices. 419

it has developed an empirical conception of ontology. This approach claimed that what was traditionally considered the province of metaphysics, namely, the issue of what the world is made up of, is in actuality decided through specific, historical, cultural, technological and scientific interventions and as such, should be studied in empirical terms. As mentioned, this has specific implications for politics because ontology is shown to have political dimensions in and of itself. If ontologies vary over time, then the matter of what exists may be transformed from a given into an issue at stake. 423

Experimental ontology considers the deliberate investment of non-humans with moral and political capacities. Here objects, and by extension ontologies, have political and moral capacities ‘by design’. Experimental ontology, too, treats the issue of ‘what the world is made up of’ as something that gets partly decided in empirical practices. But it goes beyond that in a number of ways. It directs attention to efforts to purposefully design politics and morality into material objects, devices and settings. [@Marres_2013, 423]

Experimental ontology takes up the empirical ontological idea that non-humans have political capacities but deviates from it by undoing the distinction between constituting and constituted politics and democracy. In experimental ontology, the politics of non-humans cannot be relegated to the plane of constitutive ontology. The deliberate investment of things with normative capacities equally operates upon constituted ontologies, the forms of public life there enabled. 424

It is not the case that empirical practice does the work of theory; rather, in this setting, empirical and theoretical work is shared among differently positioned actors to the point that this distinction between the conceptual and the empirical becomes blurred and unstable. 435


Experimental political ontology offers a different approach. It proposes that the investment of non-humans with political capacities and their insertion into democracy are projects of experimental settings. Experimental ontology rejects the idea that the problem of non-humans for democracy is merely a problem of theory. It is also a problem of practice, and we should not assume any simple distinction between the two. In this way, experimental ontology simply elaborates a point long advocated by empirical ontologists, which is that attempts to conclusively separate the empirical from the theoretical, and to bracket the one while dealing with the other, do not do justice to what happens in practice. 437

empirical devices allow for the display of material efficacy inside the frame of the empirical setting, and arguably these devices assist in the specification of material engagement as a distinctive mode of public involvement. It is a bit of a headache, but politics, ontology, the empirical and the public have to be taken in at once.
