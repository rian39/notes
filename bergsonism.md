Deleuze, Gilles, Bergsonism, tr. Barbara Habberjam & Hugh Tomlinson, Zone Books, NY, 1988

FIRST RULE: Apply the test of true and false to problems themselves. Condemn false problems and reconcile truth and creation at the level of problems 15

SECOND RULE: Struggle against illusion, rediscover the true differences in kind or articulations of real. 21

THIRD RULE: State problems and solve them in terms of time rather than of space. 31

Thus intuition does form a method with its three (or five) rules. This is an essentially problematizing method (a critique of false problems and the invention of genuine ones), differentiating (carvings out and intersections), temporalizing (thinking in terms of duration). 35

[I]t is the solution that counts, but the problem always has the solution it deserves, in terms of the way in which it is stated (i.e., the conditions under which it is determined as a problem), and of the means and terms at our disposal for stating it. (16)

We tend to think in terms of more or less, that is, to see difference in degree where there are differences in kind. We can only react against this intellectual tendency by bringing to life, again in  the intelligence, another tendency, which is critical. But where, precisely, does this second tendency come from? Only intuition can produce and activate it, because it rediscovers differences in kind beneath the differences in degree, and conveys to intelligence the criteria that enable it to distinguish between true and false problems. 21 {#numbering} {#differences} {#method}

Intuition is rather the movement by which we emerge from our own duration, by which we make use of our own duration to affirm and immediately to recognize the existence of other durations, above or below us (33).
