stack as accidental megastructure 5

In the figure of The Stack, see not one totality but the production of multiple and incongruous totalities, some of which are "interfacial regimes," some are superimposed landscapes of _Addresses_, and others are interwoven _Cloud_ and state geometries. 12

These geometries both draw and draw on the vertical platform of The Stack, and in doing so may also displace existing geographies with several alternatives at once 12. 

The Stack emerges not only as a global technical system but as geopolitical geography. 19

as hybrids they are not well suited to conventional research programs 41

They are a different but possibly equally powerful and important form. 41

A working technical definition of _platform_, in general, may include references to a _standards-based technical-economic systems that simultaneously distributes interfaces through their remote coordination and centralizes their integrated control through that same coordination_. 42 {#platform-definition}

What I call platform logics  ... 

The Stack is a platform, or, more accurately, a combination of platforms. 42. 

Etymology of platform p43; 

chapter 41-72 is about platforms {#platform-literature}

'rigorous standardization of the scale, duration, and morphology of their essential components' (47). 

The Stack may represent an epochal enclosure of the planet under an absolutist regime of algorithmic capital, or the fragility of its totality may force new breaks 72 

Cloud Layer chapter around 127 --- has sections on major platforms such as amazon, google, Facebook, etc {#platform-list}
 
Next to states and markets, platforms are a third form, coordinating through fixed protocols while scattering free-range _Users_ watched over in loving if also disconcertingly omniscient grace. 328 {#platform-definition} 

Platforms are emergent systems that are informed by power. 357

All stacks are platforms, but not all platforms are stacks. Ultimately platforms can be seen not only as a technical model but also an institutional form along with states and markets. 374  {#platform-definition}
