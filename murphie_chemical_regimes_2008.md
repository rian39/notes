It has become a truism that synthetic chemicals have traveled to distant crevices  and niches  of the globe.  Largely  produced  by  over  a century  of petroleum dependent  industrialized  capitalism,  these  varied  molecular  modifications  range in duration, mobility, and effect,offering us a world changed in ways both subtle and  overwhelming.  The  intensification of production  and  consumption  in recent decades has yielded  a chemically  recomposed  planetary  atmosphere  to alarming future  effect, while  it has  penetrated  the air, waters,  and  soils  to accumulate  into the  very  flesh  of organisms,  from plankton  to humans.  696


For  Rose,  the molecularization  of  life  in biomedicine  also  is characterized  by  a new  "style  of  thought"  modeled  on genomics that  emphasizes  information,  individualized  risks  and  individualized variations. 696

But  when  it comes  to questions  of pollution, it is more appropriate to discuss  the historical  emergence  of a chemical regime  of living,  in which  molecular  relations  extend  outside  of the organic  realm and  create  interconnections  with  landscapes,  production,  and  consumption, requiring us to tie the history of technoscience with political economy.697
 


We historians too are now part of this conjuncture, tracking molecular pathways that overflow the norms of social status and national borders, or even the time span of a human life. We too are struggling to find conceptual tools through which to capture this complex and uncertain set of phenomena. Instead of a chain, or a focus on bodies, the notion of a chemical regime of living might  better provoke questions more adequate  to the history  of this entangled  and enfolded  political economy of molecular relations 701
