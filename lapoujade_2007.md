 james distinguishes belief and faith. Belief relies on determinacies of habit; faith depends on indeterminacy. There is no belief without faith, but their faith without belief. 106

 to believe is to expect and wait. To have faith is to anticipate and hope 107

 it is indeterminacy that means one needs faith, but it is equally so that because one has faith, one risks oneself in indeterminacy

 we need indeterminacy in order to have faith just as much as indeterminacy creates our need for faith. 108

symptoms of crisis of faith - loss of world; not loss of perceptions, but of subtle links that signifying having a world. 109
impossibility of signifying, of producing connections, of acting 110

variations of the sentiment of faith correspond to the variations of intensites traversing the flux of Cs. 110
