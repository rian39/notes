Asignifying semiotics (stock listings, currencies, corporate accounting, national budgets, computer languages, mathematics, scientific functions and equations as well as the asignifying semiotics of music, art, etc.) are not beholden to significations and the individuated subjects who convey them. They slip past rather than produce significations or representations. 80

It is utterly insufficient to conceive of the machine in terms of technique. The machine is at once material and semiotic, actual and virtual, assemblage. On the one hand, before being a technique, the machine is diagrammatic, that is, inhabited by diagrams, plans and equations. On the other hand, in the machine there are "visible, synchronic" dimensions (the assemblage of component parts, plans, equations) but also virtual, diachronic dimensions, since it is situated at the intersection of a series of past machines and the infinity of machines to come. 81-82

Ontological mutations are always machinic. They are never the simple result of the actions or choices of the "man" who, leaving the assemblage, removes himself from the non-human, technical, or incorporeal elements that constitute him -- all that is pure abstraction. 83

The diagram is a semiotic system and a mode of writing that fulfill the conditions of power signs. (cf icons of relation in Peirce) ... Diagrammatic signs, by acting in place of things themselves, produce machinic rather than significant redundancy 86-7

Diagrams (like equations, designs, graphs, apparatuses, machines, etc.) come to accelerate or slow down, destruct or stabilize, processes of deterritorialization which language has difficulty grasping. 87

Through asignifyinn semiotics machines "speak," "express themselves," and "communicate" with man, other machines, and "real" phenomena. Through "power signs" they interact with the expression and content of the atomic and chemical strata of matter, the biological strata of the living being, and the cosmic strata of the universe. 87-88

_In a machine-centric, in order to speak, see, smell and act, we are of a piece with machines and asignifying semiotics._ 88

Long discussion of driving the car as the epitome of the partial subjectivities, etc 89

The thought and consciousness of the individuated subject come into play when there is an obstacle, a disturbance, or an "event." Then the subject, consciousness, and representation are used in order to modify the feedback relations among the human and non-human components of the automobile "machine," in order to reestablish the automatic mechanisms and machinic operations. 89-90

Without "machines," without asignifying semiotics, without diagrams, there is no capitalism. There are indeed relations of domination, power, and subjections 90

We must free the human and non-human forces that the first industrial revolution imprisoned in _labor, language_ and _life_, and do so not order to find an "original" subjectivity, but to open and activate other processes of its production by seizing on the deterritorialization of work, language and life as an opportunity.
