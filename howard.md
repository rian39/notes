The Biolnformatics Gold Rush, Ken Howard, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN July 2000 

Add to the mix the data pouring in about the genomes of so-called model organisms such as fruit flies and mice... and you have what Gene Myers,  vice president of informatics research at Celera Oenomics in Erockville, Md. calls “a tsunami of information." 46

Once they found near-matches for the sequences, they carried out further analyses and discovered that one sequence in particular was overexpressed by the osteoclast cells and that it matched those of a previously identified class of molecules: cathepsins. For SmithKline Beecham, that exercise in bioinformatics yielded in just weeks a promising drug target that standard laboratory experiments could not have found without years and a pinch of luck. 49

Lion Bioscience, based in Hei-delberg, Germany, has been particularly successful at selling "enterprise-wide" bioinformatics tools and services. 50
