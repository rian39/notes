What connections may be perceived concretely or in point of fact, among the parts of the collection abstractly designated as our ‘world’? {#ensemble}

There are innumerable modes of union among its parts, some obtaining on a larger, some on a smaller scale. 126

From the point of view of these partial systems, the world hangs together from next to next in a variety of ways, so that when you are off of one thing you can always be on to something else, without every dropping out of your world. 131

To sum up, the world is ‘one’ in some respects, and ‘many’ in others. But the respects must be distinctly specified, if either statement is to be more than the emptiest abstraction. Once we are committed to this soberer view, the question of the One or the Many may well cease to be important. The amount of either unity or plurality is in short only a matter for observation to ascertain and write down, in statements which will have to be complicated, in spite of every effort to be precise. 133-4 {#ensemble} {#thought}
