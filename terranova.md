Terranova, Tiziana, 'Free labor: producing culture for the digital economy', Social Text 63 vol 18: 33-57
Rather than capital 'incorporating' from the outside the authentic fruits of the collective imagination, it seems more reasonable to think of cultural flows as originating within a field which is always and already capitalism. Incorporation is not about capital descending on authentic culture, but a more immanent process of channelling of collective labor (even as cultural labor) into monetary flows and its structuration within capitalist business practices. Digitalisation ups the stakes of this voracious process: within the digital economy, cultural production is channeled in ways which reveal certain specificities about the latest developments of capital which are worth exploring, thinking and acting upon.
