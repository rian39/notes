It follows that a core concern might be to scrutinize how pattern is derived
and produced in social inscription devices, as a means of considering the robust-
ness of such derivations, what may be left out or made invisible from them, and
so forth. We need to develop an account which seeks to criticize notions of the
descriptive insofar as this involves the simple generation of categories and
groups, and instead focus on the fluid and intensive generation of potential. Savage. 2009, 171
