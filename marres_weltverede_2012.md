Scraping, we propose, makes it possible to render traffic between the object and process of social research analytically productive. It enables a form of ‘real-time’ social research, in which the formats and life cycles of online data may lend structure to the analytic objects and findings of social research. ???

The focus on the empirical deployment of device-specific categories gives yet another twist on the sociological debate about the status of its categories. The aim is not only to determine which formats and categories are analytically most productive for social research, i.e. to determine relevant ways of the carving of the world. It is also a question of operationalising devices with currency in social life ‘out there’ for purposes of social research. 326

Live social research, to summarise, is social research that seeks to render analytically productive the formatted, dynamic character of digital networked data. As such, this research practice endorses the dynamism or ‘shape-shifting’ of online data, turning these into a resource and an object of digital social research. 327

In live social research, the key question is not what topics, sources and actors have the most currency at a given moment (‘now’). Instead, the crucial question for those researching social dynamics is which entities are the most happening: which terms, sources, actors are the most active, which fluctuate most interestingly over a certain period 327
