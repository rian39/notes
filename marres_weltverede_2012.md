Scraping, we propose, makes it possible to render traffic between the object and process of social research analytically productive. It enables a form of ‘real-time’ social research, in which the formats and life cycles of online data may lend structure to the analytic objects and findings of social research. ??? {#device} {#method}

The focus on the empirical deployment of device-specific categories gives yet another twist on the sociological debate about the status of its categories. The aim is not only to determine which formats and categories are analytically most productive for social research, i.e. to determine relevant ways of the carving of the world. It is also a question of operationalising devices with currency in social life ‘out there’ for purposes of social research. 326 {#ambiguity}

Live social research, to summarise, is social research that seeks to render analytically productive the formatted, dynamic character of digital networked data. As such, this research practice endorses the dynamism or ‘shape-shifting’ of online data, turning these into a resource and an object of digital social research. 327

In live social research, the key question is not what topics, sources and actors have the most currency at a given moment (‘now’). Instead, the crucial question for those researching social dynamics is which entities are the most happening: which terms, sources, actors are the most active, which fluctuate most interestingly over a certain period 327 {#change}


>This circumstance defines both the key challenge and opportunity of scraping for social research: if scraping is already deployed in the ‘real-time Web’, what does social research hope to contribute by taking up scraping? To what additional or alternative purposes might scrapers be put in/by social research? [@Marres_2013, 315]

> Scraping, then, is a multi-faceted phenomenon. It offers a technique for auto- matically capturing online data, but it is also an important component of a broader analytic practice, one that is marked by the rise of the ‘real-time Web,’ and the dynamic kinds of information services it enables. Scraping is also a social practice, one in which teachers and students share recipes, and programmers and researchers exchange scraper data and applications. Finally, scraping seems to imply a distinctive approach to knowledge-making. It arguably comes with an epistemology built in: scraping formats the process of data collection and analysis as an operation of extraction, and organises knowledge-making as a distillation process. One could say that the combination of these different features is what makes scraping not simply a technology, but a ‘socio-technical device’ as sociological parlance has it. [@Marres_2013, 319]

>Arguably, digital social research displaces this debate about the provenance of the analytic categories of social research onto the plane of devices: the question here becomes how the categories and formats implicit in digital technologies structure our social data and analysis. 321

>Scrapers, that is, force the question of how we establish the difference between researching the medium and researching the social. Scraping suggests that this distinction may be a lot less stable or robust than we are inclined to think. And this in turn, opens up a further question: why would we as social researchers ever accept this muddying of the waters? Why would we allow our definition of social life, as something distinct from or exceeding media accounts of it, be unsettled in this way? 322

>In the case of scraping, too, it seems impossible to make straightforward distinctions between the instruments, methods and objects of digital social research. 323-324
