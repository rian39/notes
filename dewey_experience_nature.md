> Events change; one individual gives place to another. But individually qualified things have some qualities which are pervasive, common, stable. They are out of time in the sense that a particular temporal quality is irrelevant to them. ... These non-temporal, mathematical or logical qualities are capable of abstraction, and of conversion into relations, into temporal, numerical and spatial _order_. As such, they are dialectical, non-existential. But also as such they are tools, instrumentalities applicable [to] historic events to help regulate their course' [@Dewey_1958, 148-149]

> Experience when it happens has the same dependence upon objective natural events, physical and social, as has the occurrence of a house [@Dewey_1958, 232]  {#experience}

It has its own objective and definitive traits; these can be described precisely as a house is of brick, has eight rooms, etc., irrespective of whom it belongs to, 232

>A differential has to [be] found in distinctive _ways_ of experiencing natural objects;  236 {#experience}

For a perceived mode of becoming is always ready to be translated into a method of production and direction. 237

That an individual, possessed of some mode and degree be of organized unity, participates in the genesis of every experienced situation, whether it be an object or an activity, is evident. That the way in which it is engaged affects the quality of the situation experienced is evident. That the way in which it is engaged has consequences that modify not merely the environment but which react to modify the active agent; that every form of life in the higher organisms constantly conserves some consequences of its prior experiences, is also evident. The constancy and pervasiveness of the operative presence of the self as a determining factor in all situations is the chief reason why we give so little heed to it; it is more intimate and omnipresent in experience than the air we breathe. 246 {#experience}

Yet till we understand operations of the self as the tool of tools, the means in all use of means, specifying its differential activities in their distinctive consequences in varying qualities of what is experienced, science is incomplete and the use made of it is at the mercy of an unknown factor, so that the ultimate and important consequence is in so far a matter of accident.247 {#self} {#technique}


the point of maximum apparency is also the point of greatest strees and undetermined potentiality' (349) {#indeterminacy}

- Dewey has an account of experience for the Greeks deriving from practical arts, but being too closely connected to nature, to much participating in nature and its cosmos, to count as primaryh {#experience} Experience, especially of meanings, perceptions, etc., derive from the interaction between heavily habituated slow-moving systems of action with 'swift-moving, un stable, unsubstantial events' [@Dewey_1958, 351]
