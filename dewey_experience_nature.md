But when the secondary objects, the refined objects, are employed as a method or road for coming at them, it may be etc. these qualities cease to be isolated details; meaning contained in a they get the whole system of related objects; they are rendered continuous with the rest of nature and now The phenomena observed in take on the import of the things they are seen to be continuous with. [@Dewey_1958, 5] 

"Experience" denotes the planted field, the sowed seeds, the reaped harvests, the changes of night spring and autumn, wet and dry, heat and observed, feared, longed for; it and day, cold, that are also denotes the one who who works and rejoices, hopes, fears, invokes plans, magic or chemistry to aid him, who is down- cast or triumphant. It is "double-barrelled" in that it plants and reaps, recognizes in its primary integrity no division between act and material, subject and object, but contains them both in an unanalyzed totality. "Thing" and "thought," as in the same connection, are single-barrelled; 8

What is really "in" experience extends much further than that which at any time is known. From the standpoint of rence of illusions is knowledge, objects must be distinct; their traits must be Hence explicit; the vague and unrevealed is a limitation. Whenever the habit of identifying reality with the object of knowledge as such prevails, the obscure and vague are explained away. 20

Honest empirical method why will state when and where and the act of selection took place, and thus enable others Selective choice, denoted as it and test its worth. 30

First, that refined methods and products be traced back primary experience, in all its hetero- so that the needs and problems out of to their origin in geneity and fullness ; which they arise and which they have to satisfy be acknowledged. Secondly, that the secondary methods and conclusions be brought back to the things of ordinary experience, in all their coarseness and crudity, for verification. 36

Only by identification with remaking the objects that  now obtain are we saved from complacent objectivism. 246 {#making} {#objectivity}{#participation}

> Events change; one individual gives place to another. But individually qualified things have some qualities which are pervasive, common, stable. They are out of time in the sense that a particular temporal quality is irrelevant to them. ... These non-temporal, mathematical or logical qualities are capable of abstraction, and of conversion into relations, into temporal, numerical and spatial _order_. As such, they are dialectical, non-existential. But also as such they are tools, instrumentalities applicable [to] historic events to help regulate their course' [@Dewey_1958, 148-149]

> Experience when it happens has the same dependence upon objective natural events, physical and social, as has the occurrence of a house [@Dewey_1958, 232]  {#experience}

It has its own objective and definitive traits; these can be described precisely as a house is of brick, has eight rooms, etc., irrespective of whom it belongs to, 232

>A differential has to [be] found in distinctive _ways_ of experiencing natural objects;  236 {#experience}

For a perceived mode of becoming is always ready to be translated into a method of production and direction. 237

That an individual, possessed of some mode and degree be of organized unity, participates in the genesis of every experienced situation, whether it be an object or an activity, is evident. That the way in which it is engaged affects the quality of the situation experienced is evident. That the way in which it is engaged has consequences that modify not merely the environment but which react to modify the active agent; that every form of life in the higher organisms constantly conserves some consequences of its prior experiences, is also evident. The constancy and pervasiveness of the operative presence of the self as a determining factor in all situations is the chief reason why we give so little heed to it; it is more intimate and omnipresent in experience than the air we breathe. 246 {#experience}

Yet till we understand operations of the self as the tool of tools, the means in all use of means, specifying its differential activities in their distinctive consequences in varying qualities of what is experienced, science is incomplete and the use made of it is at the mercy of an unknown factor, so that the ultimate and important consequence is in so far a matter of accident.247 {#self} {#technique}

- Dewey has an account of experience for the Greeks deriving from practical arts, but being too closely connected to nature, to much participating in nature and its cosmos, to count as primaryh {#experience} Experience, especially of meanings, perceptions, etc., derive from the interaction between heavily habituated slow-moving systems of action with 'swift-moving, un stable, unsubstantial events' [@Dewey_1958, 351]
