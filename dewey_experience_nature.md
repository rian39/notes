>The *intrinsic* nature of events is revealed in experience as the immediately felt qualities of things. [@Dewey_1958, xii]
The intimate co- ordination and even fusion of these qualities with the regularities that form the objects of knowledge, in the proper sense of the word "knowledge," characterizes intel- ligently directed experience, as distinct from mere casual and uncritical experience.

But when the secondary objects, the refined objects, are employed as a method or road for coming at them, it may be etc. these qualities cease to be isolated details; meaning contained in a they get the whole system of related objects; they are rendered continuous with the rest of nature and now The phenomena observed in take on the import of the things they are seen to be continuous with. [@Dewey_1958, 5] 

"Experience" denotes the planted field, the sowed seeds, the reaped harvests, the changes of night spring and autumn, wet and dry, heat and observed, feared, longed for; it and day, cold, that are also denotes the one who who works and rejoices, hopes, fears, invokes plans, magic or chemistry to aid him, who is down- cast or triumphant. It is "double-barrelled" in that it plants and reaps, recognizes in its primary integrity no division between act and material, subject and object, but contains them both in an unanalyzed totality. "Thing" and "thought," as in the same connection, are single-barrelled; 8

What is really "in" experience extends much further than that which at any time is *known.* From the standpoint of  knowledge, objects must be distinct; their traits must be explicit; the vague and unrevealed is a limitation. Hence whenever the habit of identifying reality with the object of knowledge as such prevails, the obscure and vague are explained away. 20

Honest empirical method why will state when and where and the act of selection took place, and thus enable others Selective choice, denoted as it and test its worth. 30

First, that refined methods and products be traced back primary experience, in all its hetero- so that the needs and problems out of to their origin in geneity and fullness ; which they arise and which they have to satisfy be acknowledged. Secondly, that the secondary methods and conclusions be brought back to the things of ordinary experience, in all their coarseness and crudity, for verification. 36

We confine ourselves to one outstanding fact: the evidence that the world of empirical things includes the uncertain, unpredictable, uncontrollable, and hazardous. 42

We live in a world which is an impressive and irresistible mixture of sufficiencies, tight completenesses, order, recurrences which make possible prediction and control, and singularities, ambiguities, uncertain possibilities, processes going on to consequences as yet indeterminate. They are mixed not mechanically but vitally like the wheat and tares of the parable. We may recognize them separately but we cannot divide them, for unlike wheat and tares they grow from the same root. 47

Although imagination is often fantastic it is an organ of nature; for it is the appropriate phase of indeterminate events moving toward eventualities that are now but possibilities. A purely stable world permits of no illusions, but neither is it clothed with ideals. It just exists. 62


While the precarious nature of existence is indeed the source of all its trouble, it is also an indispensable condition of ideality, becoming a sufficient condition when conjoined with the regular and assured. We long, amid a troubled world, for perfect being. 63


It thus notes that thinking is no different in kind from the use of natural materials and energies, say fire and tools, to refine, re-order, and shape other natural materials, say ore. 67

The ultimate evidence of genuine hazard, contingency, irregularity and indeterminateness in nature is thus found in the occurrence of thinking. 69

Human experience in the large, in its coarse and conspicuous features, has for one of its most striking features preoccupation with direct enjoyment, feasting and festivities; ornamentation, dance, song, dramatic pantomime, telling yarns and enacting stories.79 

The other most self-evident thing in experience is useful labor and its coercive necessity. As direct appreciative enjoyment exhibits things in their consummatory phase, labor manifests things in their connections of things with one another, in efficiency, productivity, furthering, hindering, generating, destroying. 84 

But in every event there is something obdurate, self-sufficient, wholly immediate, neither a relation nor an element in a relational whole, but terminal and exclusive. 85

A world that consisted entirely of stable objects directly presented and possessed would have no esthetic qualities ; it would just be, and would lack power to satisfy and to inspire. Objects are actually esthetic when they turn hazard and defeat to an issue which is above and beyond trouble and vicissitude. Festal celebration and consummatory delights belong only in a world that knows risk and hardship. 90

Objects may be more or less absorptive and arresting and thus possess degrees of intensity with respect to finality. But this difference of intensity is not, save as subject to reflective choice, a distinction in rank or class of finality.
It applies to different toothaches as well as to different objects of thought; but it does not apply, inherently, to the difference between a tooth-ache and an ideal object save that a thing like a toothache is often possessed of greater intensity of finality.
If we follow the clew of the latter fact, we shall probably conclude that search for pure and unalloyed finality carries us to inarticulate sensation and overwhelming passion. For such affairs are the best instances of things that are complete in themselves with no outleadings. 106


If we recognize that all qualities directly had in conscious experience apart from use made of them, testify to nature's characterization by immediacy and finality, there is ground for unsophisticated recognition of use and enjoyment of things as natural, as belonging to the things as well as to us. Things are beautiful and ugly, lovely and hateful, dull and illuminated, attractive and repulsive. 108

The richer and fuller are the terminal qualities of an object the more precarious is the latter, because of its dependence upon a greater diversity of events 117

A tool denotes a perception and acknowledgment of sequential bonds in nature. 123

The very conception of cognitive meaning, intellectual significance, is that things in their immediacy are subordinated to what they portend and give evidence of. An intellectual sign denotes that a thing is not taken immediately but is referred to some- thing that may come in consequence of it.128

Empirically, individualized objects, unique affair*, exist. But they are evanescent, unstable. They tremble on the verge of disappearance as soon as they appear. Useful arts prove that, within limits, neglect of their uniqueness and attention to what is common, recurrent, irrelevant to time, procures and perpetuates the happen- ing of some of these unique things. 148


> Events change; one individual gives place to another. But individually qualified things have some qualities which are pervasive, common, stable. They are out of time in the sense that a particular temporal quality is irrelevant to them. ... These non-temporal, mathematical or logical qualities are capable of abstraction, and of conversion into relations, into temporal, numerical and spatial _order_. As such, they are dialectical, non-existential. But also as such they are tools, instrumentalities applicable [to] historic events to help regulate their course' [@Dewey_1958, 148-149]

> Experience when it happens has the same dependence upon objective natural events, physical and social, as has the occurrence of a house [@Dewey_1958, 232]  {#experience}

It has its own objective and definitive traits; these can be described precisely as a house is of brick, has eight rooms, etc., irrespective of whom it belongs to, 232

>A differential has to [be] found in distinctive _ways_ of experiencing natural objects;  236 {#experience}

For a perceived mode of becoming is always ready to be translated into a method of production and direction. 237

That an individual, possessed of some mode and degree be of organized unity, participates in the genesis of every experienced situation, whether it be an object or an activity, is evident. That the way in which it is engaged affects the quality of the situation experienced is evident. That the way in which it is engaged has consequences that modify not merely the environment but which react to modify the active agent; that every form of life in the higher organisms constantly conserves some consequences of its prior experiences, is also evident. The constancy and pervasiveness of the operative presence of the self as a determining factor in all situations is the chief reason why we give so little heed to it; it is more intimate and omnipresent in experience than the air we breathe. 246 {#experience}

Only by identification with remaking the objects that  now obtain are we saved from complacent objectivism. 246 {#making} {#objectivity}{#participation}

Yet till we understand operations of the self as the tool of tools, the means in all use of means, specifying its differential activities in their distinctive consequences in varying qualities of what is experienced, science is incomplete and the use made of it is at the mercy of an unknown factor, so that the ultimate and important consequence is in so far a matter of accident.247 {#self} {#technique}

But in an organic creature sensitive to light, these differences of potentiality may be realized as differences in immediate sentiency. To say that they are *felt*  is to say that they come to independent and intrinsic existence on their own account. The proposition does not mean that feeling has been extraneously super- added to something else, or that a mode of extrinsic cognitive access to a purely physical thing has entered intrusively into a world of physical things. "Feeling" is in general a name for the newly actualized quality acquired by events previously occurring upon a physical level, when these events come into more extensive and delicate relationships of interaction. 267

Thus an environment both extensive and enduring is immediately implicated in present behavior. Operatively speaking, the remote and the past are "in" behavior making it what it is. The action called "organic" is not just that of internal structures. It is  an integration of organic-environmental  connections. 279

By a seeming paradox, increased power of forming habits means increased sus- ceptibility, sensitiveness, responsiveness. Thus even if we think of habits as so many grooves, the power to acquire many and varied grooves denotes high sensitivity, explosiveness. 281

the point of maximum apparency is also the point of greatest stress and undetermined potentiality' (349) {#indeterminacy}

- Dewey has an account of experience for the Greeks deriving from practical arts, but being too closely connected to nature, to much participating in nature and its cosmos, to count as primaryh {#experience} Experience, especially of meanings, perceptions, etc., derive from the interaction between heavily habituated slow-moving systems of action with 'swift-moving, un stable, unsubstantial events' [@Dewey_1958, 351]
