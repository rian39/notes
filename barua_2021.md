These more-than-human enflesh- ments and enmeshments with infrastructure, where corporeality and substrate meld or the habitat and habits of living beings get become synonymous with infrastructural environments, point to a wider infrastructural ontology. 1

The primary ‘ontology of infrastructure’ remains anthropo- centric as it centres ‘on built things, knowledge things, or people things’ (Larkin, 2013: 329). 2

In lieu, this article formulates a more expanded articulation of the constitution, effects and promises of infrastructure. By doing so, it proposes a wider infrastructural ontology that unravels through three interconnected themes: moving from the effects infrastructures have on the distribution and mobility of life, to infrastructures as a medium of life and, finally, how non-human life itself is rendered infra- structural. These themes derive from central currents of the contemporary infrastructural condition – infrastructures as architectures of circulation, as substrates generating the envir- onments of everyday life and as technologies of regulation and government. 3

Ecologists, for instance, are beginning to view development infrastructure such as roads as ‘keystones’ (Johnson et al., 2019). An inversion of the traditional keystone species concept, it is now infrastructure, or rather infra-ecologies con- stituted through the enmeshment of animals and infrastructure, that affect ecosystem function or trigger trophic cascades. A recognition of the keystone role of infrastructures has resulted in efforts to modulate animal mobilities through ‘reconciliation infrastructures’ – underpasses, tunnels and crossings designed keeping other- than-humans in mind – discussed later in the article. 5

Inde- pendent of what is transported, infrastructural movement itself – ports visited, routes taken, the volume and speed at which goods are moved – are now beginning to define what constitutes a biogeographic assemblage at any juncture. 6 

A productive entry point for analysing and specifying how infrastructure becomes a medium of life is to conceptualize infrastruc- ture as non-human habitus. 7

If repurposing encapsulates a non-human habitus which runs counter to infrastructural design, recombinance entails novel compositions that have to do with spontaneity and emergence. Recombinant systems are usually character- ized by no-analog assemblages that have no past evolutionary history of co-composition 9

Reconciliation infrastructures incorporate ecology into architectural assembly and, in effect, are an imperative to modulate the habitus of a creature. At the level of assemblages, such infrastructures are designed to provide habitats for species. The engineering of living walls and roofs to enable plant and animal communities to thrive on grey infrastructure is a case in point (Francis and Lorimer, 2011). 10

Large amounts of data generated in such venues serve strive to render animals trackable and therefore amenable to cal- culation and control. They feed into imaginaries of ‘data-behaviourism’ where design is flouted as12 a means of governing futures through ‘complex- ity’ rather than democratic dispute (Grove et al., 2019), while global automobile industries and ‘the fossil fuel-enabled circulation of goods and people characteristic of the Capitalocene’ prolif- erate ‘without disruption’ (White, 2020; n.p.).10-11

Repurposing, recombinance and reconciliation are useful entry points for parsing some of the diverse agencies at work and the forms of biopolitics that unfold through modulations of habitat and habit. While repurposing works against the grain of planning and design, recombinant and reconciliation infrastructures are exemplars of how other-than-human life is subjected to con- stant infrastructural amendment, sometimes with particular aims of governance or accumu- lation in mind. Infrastructure as habitus pro- vides a set of complementary analytics to cognate takes on infrastructures as media ecol- ogies (Parikka, 2013), and perspectives on infrastructure as substrates generating ambient environments of life (Star, 1999), to formulate a richer account of the bio- and cosmopolitics at stake when infrastructures become the medium of other-than-human life. Habitus becomes cru- cial for grasping the ecologies and politics of infrastructure, taking it beyond the narrow ambit of the built environment and humanist assembly. 12

Emerging bestiaries of non-human infra- structures are heterogeneous but, for heuristic purposes, one might see these in four modes – provisioning, ecological, biosecurity and resili- ence infrastructures (Barua, 2020) – each of which harness lively potentials in different ways and are caught up with different iterations of contemporary capitalist biopolitics. 13

Such infrastructuring of other-than-human life inverts the trope of deploying infrastructure to engineer animals’ atmospheres into one of enrol- ling animals to sense and engineer atmospheres. As a result, what constitutes infrastructure shifts from built things and substrates to living beings and their mediatic capacities, which may be harnessed for purposes of securing human life. 15


Although agencies at work might be diverse, what is common is that both sets of minor infra- structures entail forms of collaboration and improvisation that provide collective platforms for reproducing everyday life. Here, the media- tic capacities of non-human bodies are put to ends other than those of capitalist expansion: 16 The three interrelated themes – infrastructures as modalities of circu- lation, as a medium of life and the infrastructur- ing of non-human life – are less about bringing diverse agencies and potentials under a singular term and more to do with what is a plural con- versation around infrastructure. 16
