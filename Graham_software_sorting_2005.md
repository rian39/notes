the application of softwaresorting systems is far from being some simple, deterministic or one-dimensional technological or political-economic shift, 565

it is very clear from this discussion that software-sorting must be at the centre of any attempt to conceptualize the formation, maintenance and experience of social and geographical inequalities within contemporary capitalist societies. A pressing imperative for human geography, in particular, is to fully address, and excavate, the power ofcode and software-sorting techniques in continually orchestrating the geographies of contemporary inequality.575 

mobility within software- sorted domains. How, for example, do such techniques influence the identities, experiences, affect and perceptions of those on the receiving end of software-sorting? Does the varying level of (in)visibility among such techniques - for example between relatively invisible electronic mobility systems and relatively visible city street and physical transport systems - affect such subjectivities and experiences? 576

Given the inevitably confidential, proprietary and highly technical nature of the core algorithms that now socially sort so many key social domains, what research techniques and paradigms can offer any genuine assistance here? Clearly, the research challenges here are considerable. This is especially so given that, from the point of view of social geographic research, the worlds of software-sorting tend not to be amenable in any meaningful way to traditional geographical or social scientific research techniques and conceptualizations. 576 {#method} {#power} {#classify}
