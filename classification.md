List-making has frequently been seen as one of the foundational activities of advanced human society. 188

In the face of incompatible information or data structures among users or among those specifying the system, attempts to create unitary knowledge categories are futile. Rather, parallel or multiple-representational forms are required. 207

Imposed standards will produce workarounds. Because imposed standards cannot account for every local contingency, users will tailor standardized forms, information systems, schedules, etc. to fit their needs. A good summary of this appeared recently on a feminist button proclaiming, ‘One size does NOT fit all!' Gasser (1986) identified three major classes of such informal responses to imposed standards: fitting, augmenting, and working around. In terms of designing tools for distributed, organizational decision- and policymaking, a detailed catalogue and analysis of such responses could become part of the designers' toolkit; incorporated in the system, could point out styles of workarounds at the level of coding. 208
