What is philosophy?
The object of science is not concepts but rather functions that are presented as propositions in discursive systems. 117
The elements of functions are called functives. 117
When an object – a geometrical space, for example – is scientifically constructed by functions, its philosophical concept, which is by no means given in the function, must still be discovered. 117
It is a fantastic slowing down,  and it is by slowing down that matter, as well as the scientific thought able to penetrate it with propositions, is actualized. A function is a Slow-motion. 118
The respective independence of variables appears in mathematics when one of them is at a higher power than the first. 122
The etats des choses is a function: it is a complex variable that depends on a relation between at least two independent variables 122
An etats des choses or “derivative” function depends on such a relation: an operation of depotentialization has been carried out that makes possible the comparison of distinct powers starting from which a thing or a body may well develop (integration). 122
When we go from the state of affairs to the thing itself, we see that a thing is always related to several exes at once according to variables that are functions of each other, even if the internal unit remains undetermined.  122
But when the things itself undergoes changes of coordinates, strictly speaking it becomes a body, and instead of the function taking the limit and the variable as reference, it takes an invariant and a group of transformations. 122
The difference between body and state of affairs (or thing) pertains to the individuation of the body, which proceeds by a cascade of actualizations. 123
Thus we find ourselves confronting a new string of functives, systems of coordinates, potentials, states of affairs (etats des choses), things and bodies. Etats des choses are ordered mixtures, of very different types, which may even only concern trajectories. But things are interactions, and bodies are communications. Etats des choses refer to geometrical coordinates of supposedly closed systems, things, refer to energetic coordinates of coupled systmes, and bodies refer to informational coordinates of separated, unconnected systems. 123

Concepts and functions thus appear as two types of multiplicities or varieties whose natures are different. 127
science brings to light partial observers  in relation to functions within systems of reference.129
in short, the role of the partial observer is to perceive and to experience , although these perceptions and affections are not those of a man, in the currently accepted sense, but belong to the things studied. 130
Rather than oppose sensory knowledge and scientific knowledge, we should identify the sensibilia that populate systems of coordinates and are peculiar to science 131
Far from sensibilia being defined by instruments, since the latter are waiting for a real observer to come and see, it is instruments that presuppose the ideal partial observer situated at a good vantage poitn in things: 131
But the fact that there are specifically philosophical perceptions and affections and specifically scientific ones --- in short, sensibilia of the concept and sensibilia of the function – already indicates the basis of a relationship between science and philosophy, science and art … such that we can say that a function is beautiful. 132
The function in science determines a state of affairs, thing, or body that actualizes the virtual on a plane of reference and in a system of coordinates 133
How are we to conceive of practical transitions between the two sorts of problems? 133
Functions derive all their power from reference, whether this be reference to states of affairs, things, or other propositions. 138
Acts of reference are finite movements of thought by which science constitutes or modifies states of affairs and bodies. 
States of affairs … are mixtures 153
