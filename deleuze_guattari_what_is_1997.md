##   What is philosophy?

But the concept is not given, it is created; it is to be created. It is not formed but posits itself in itself -- it is self-positing.  11

Philosophers have not been sufficiently concerned with the nature of the concept as philosophical reality. 11

There are no simple concepts. Every concept has components and is defined by them. It therefore has a combination [chiffre]  15

Concepts are only created as a function of problems which are thought to be badly understood or posed (pedagogy of the concept)  16

it renders components inseparable _within itself_ 19

the concept also has an exoconsistency with other concepts, when their respective creation implies the construction of a bridge on the same plane. Zones and bridges are the joints of the concept 20

each concept will therefore be considered as the point of coincidence, condensation, or accumulation of its components 20

a concept is a heterogenesis -- that is to say, an ordering of its components by zones of neighbourhood  20

a concept ... is a refrain, an opus with its number [chiffre] 21  {#concept} {#numbering}

the concept is not discursive, and philosophy is not a discursive formation, because it does not link propositions together 22

Concepts are centres of vibration, each in itself and every one in relation to all the others 23 {#concept} {#ensemble}

They do form a wall, but it is a dry-stone wall, and everything holds together only along diverging lines 23.   {#concept} {#ensemble} {#architecture}

Discussion of the signed concept Cogito

not historical novelty 'but the power of their becoming when they pass into one another'  32

Every concept shapes and reshapes the event in its own way 34

Not the concept of all concepts 35

Make up the 'slow beings' we are 36

The object of science is not concepts but rather functions that are presented as propositions in discursive systems. 117

The elements of functions are called functives. 117

When an object – a geometrical space, for example – is scientifically constructed by functions, its philosophical concept, which is by no means given in the function, must still be discovered. 117 {#concept} {#platform-definition}

It is a fantastic slowing down,  and it is by slowing down that matter, as well as the scientific thought able to penetrate it with propositions, is actualized. A function is a Slow-motion. 118

The respective independence of variables appears in mathematics when one of them is at a higher power than the first. 122

The _etats des choses_ is a function: it is a complex variable that depends on a relation between at least two independent variables 122

An etats des choses or “derivative” function depends on such a relation: an operation of depotentialization has been carried out that makes possible the comparison of distinct powers starting from which a thing or a body may well develop (integration). 122

When we go from the state of affairs to the thing itself, we see that a thing is always related to several axes at once according to variables that are functions of each other, even if the internal unit remains undetermined.  122

But when the things itself undergoes changes of coordinates, strictly speaking it becomes a body, and instead of the function taking the limit and the variable as reference, it takes an invariant and a group of transformations. 122

The difference between body and state of affairs (or thing) pertains to the individuation of the body, which proceeds by a cascade of actualizations. 123

Thus we find ourselves confronting a new string of functives, systems of coordinates, potentials, states of affairs (etats des choses), things and bodies. Etats des choses are ordered mixtures, of very different types, which may even only concern trajectories. But things are interactions, and bodies are communications. Etats des choses refer to geometrical coordinates of supposedly closed systems, things, refer to energetic coordinates of coupled systmes, and bodies refer to informational coordinates of separated, unconnected systems. 123

Concepts and functions thus appear as two types of multiplicities or varieties whose natures are different. 127 {#concept} {#function}

science brings to light partial observers  in relation to functions within systems of reference.129

in short, the role of the partial observer is to perceive and to experience , although these perceptions and affections are not those of a man, in the currently accepted sense, but belong to the things studied. 130

Rather than oppose sensory knowledge and scientific knowledge, we should identify the sensibilia that populate systems of coordinates and are peculiar to science 131

Far from sensibilia being defined by instruments, since the latter are waiting for a real observer to come and see, it is instruments that presuppose the ideal partial observer situated at a good vantage point in things: 131

But the fact that there are specifically philosophical perceptions and affections and specifically scientific ones --- in short, sensibilia of the concept and sensibilia of the function – already indicates the basis of a relationship between science and philosophy, science and art … such that we can say that a function is beautiful. 132

The function in science determines a state of affairs, thing, or body that actualizes the virtual on a plane of reference and in a system of coordinates 133

How are we to conceive of practical transitions between the two sorts of problems? 133

Functions derive all their power from reference, whether this be reference to states of affairs, things, or other propositions. 138

Acts of reference are finite movements of thought by which science constitutes or modifies states of affairs and bodies. 

States of affairs … are mixtures 153
