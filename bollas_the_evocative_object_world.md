# bollas, the evocative object world, 2009

our encounter, engagement with, and sometimes our employment of, actual things is a _way_ of thinking. 92 {#thought} {#method} {#device}

the ability to move freely in the object world, to use its thing-ness as a matrix for thinking-by-action, pivots around whether the aleatory object determines - whether we move on quickly due to the dynamic of our last encounter with the object - or whether we select objects because we are unconsciously grazing: finding food for thought that only retrospectively could be seen to have a logic. 93
