Thus one characterization of importance is that it is that aspect of feeling whereby a perspective is imposed upon the universe of things felt. 15

Matter-of-fact is an abstraction, arrived at by confining thought to purely formal relations which then masquerade as the final reality. 25

Expression is the diffusion, in the environment, of something initially entertained in the experience of the expressor. 29
The Human Body is that region of the world which is the primary field of human expression. 30

Wherever there is a region of nature which is itself the primary field of the expressions issuing from each of its parts, that region is alive, 31

Feeling (in the sense here used), or prehension, is the reception of expressions. Thus the animal body is composed of entities, which are mutually expressing and feeling. Expressions are the data for feeling diffused in the environment; and a living body is a peculiarly close adjustment of these two sides of experience, namely, expression and feeling. 32


So long as language is predominantly speech, the reference to some particularity of environment is overwhelming. 54

Perhaps our knowledge is distorted unless we can comprehend its essential connection with happenings which involve spatial relationships of fifteen dimensions. 78

All actuality involves the realization of form derived from factual data. It is both a composition of qualities, and it is also a form of composition. The form of composition dictates how those forms as thus realized in the data enter into a finite process of composition, thus achieving new actuality with its own exemplifications and discards. There is a form of process dealing with a complex form of data and issuing into a novel completion of actuality. But no actuality is a static fact. The historic character of the universe belongs to its essence. 122 -123

Conceive the fusion of two groups, each characterized by triplicity, into a single group. The whole essence of the notion of "twice-three" is process, and "twice-three" expresses its special form of process. 123-4

mathematics is concerned with certain forms of process issuing into forms which are components for further process. 126

The very notion of number refers to the process from the individual units to the compound group. The final number belongs to no one of the units; it characterizes the way in which the group unity has been attained. [@whitehead_modes_1956, 127]

The data of our experience are of two kinds. They can be analyzed into realized matter-of-fact and into potentialties for matter-of-fact. Further, these potentialities can be analysed into pure abstract potentialities apart from special relevance to realization in the data or the issue, and into potentialities entertained by reason of some closeness of relevance to such realization. These potentialities entertained in respect to their close relevance are the agents dictating the form of composition which dictates the issue 128-9.

The use of the variable  is to indicate the self-identity of some use of 'any' throughout a train of reasoning. ... Thus the variable is an ingenious combination of the vagueness of 'any' with the definiteness of a particular indication. 145

Another consequence is that 'actuality' is in its essence 'composition'. Power is the compulsion of composition. Every other type of composition is a half-way stage in the attainment of actuality. 162 -163

The main point of this description is the concept of actuality as something that matters, by reason of its own self-enjoyment, which includes enjoyment of others and transitions towards the future. 161

uprise of abstractions -- energy of self-realization 168-9
But this enhancement of energy presupposes that the abstraction is preserved with its adequate relevance to the concrete sense of value-attainment from which it is derived. In this way, the effect of the abstraction stimulates the vividness and depth of the whole of experience. 169

Thus beyond all questions of quantity, there lie questions of pattern, which are essential for the understanding of nature. Apart from a presupposed pattern, quantity determines nothing. Indeed quantity itself is nothing other than analogy of functions within analogous patterns 195

notion of pattern involves the concept of different modes of togetherness 195-6

The sharp-cut scientific classifications are essential for scientific method. But they are dangerous for philosophy. Such classification hides the truth that the different modes of natural existnece shade off into each other. 215

We have to construe the world in terms of the bodily society,  and the bodily society in terms of the general functionings of the world. 225

Science is without importance 226

Doctrine of immanence. Each occasion presupposes the antecedent world as active in its own nature. 226

It is the reason why ... in our direct apprehension of the world around us we find that curious habit of claiming a two-fold unity with the observed data. We are in the world and the world is in us. 227

My unity -- which is Descartes' "I am" --is my process of shaping this welter of material into a consistent pattern of feelings.  228

The sort of functioning here termed 'conceptual experience' is the entertainment of possibilities for ideal realization in abstraction from any sheer physical realization.The most obvious example of conceptual experience is the entertainment of alternatives. 229
 
In so far as conceptual mentality does not intervene, the grand patterns pervading the environment are passed on with the inherited modes of adjustment 230

The qualities entertained as objects in conceptual activity are of the nature of catalytic agents, in the sense in which that phrase is used in chemistry. They modify the aesthetic process by which the occasion constitutes itself out of the many streams of feeling received from the past. ... But the operation of mentality is primarily to be conceived as a diversion of the flow of energy. 231

The energetic activity considered in physics is the emotional intensity entertained in life. 232
