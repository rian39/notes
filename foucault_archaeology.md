Instead of referring back to the synthesis or the unifying function of a subject, the various enunciative modalities manifest his dispersion. To the various statuses, the various sites, the various positions that he can occupy or be given when making a discourse. To the discontinuity of the planes from which he speaks. And if these planes are linked by a system of relations, this system is not established by the synthetic activity of a consciousness identical with itself, dumb and anterior to all speech, but by the specificity of a discursive practice. 54

One stands back in relation to this manifest set of concepts; and one tries to determine according to what schemata (of series, simultaneous groupings, linear or reciprocal modification) the statements may be linked to one another in a type of discourse; one tries in this way to discover how the recurrent elements of statements can reappear, dissociate, recompose, gain in extension or determination, be taken up into new logical structures, acquire, on the other hand, new semantic contents, and constitute partial organizations among themselves. These schemata make it possible to describe - not the laws of the internal construction of concepts, not their progressive and individual genesis in the mind of man - but their anonymous dispersion through texts, books, and ceuvres. 58

Lastly, a graph, a growth curve, an age pyramid, a distribution cloud are all statements 82

an equation of the nth degree, or the algebraic  formula of the law of refraction must be regarded as statements. 82

The statement exists therefore neither in the same way as a language (langue) (although it is made up of signs that are definable in their individuality only within a natural or artificial linguistic system), nor in the same way as the objects presented to perception (although it is always endowed with a certain materiality, and can always be situated in accordance with spatio-temporal coordinates). 86

A series of signs will become a statement on condition that it possesses 'something else' (which may be strangely similar to it, and almost identical as in the example chosen), a specific relation that concerns itself- and not its cause, or its elements. 89 

A statement is not confronted (face to face, as it were) by a correlate or the absence of a correlate - as a proposition has (or has not) a referent, or as a proper noun designates someone (or no one) . It is linked rather to a 'referential' that is made up not of ' things', 'facts', 'realities', or 'beings' , but of laws of possibility, rules of existence for the objects that are named, designated, or described within it, and for the relations that are affirmed or denied in it. The referential of the statement forms the place, the condition, the field of emergence, the authority to differentiate between individuals or objects, states of things and relations that are brought into play by the statement itself; it defines the possibilities of appearance and delimitation of that which gives meaning to the sentence, a value as truth to the proposition. 91

Similarly, one might describe the specific position of the enunciating subject in sentences like 'I call straight any series of points that . . .' or 'Let there be a finite series of any elements' ; in each case the position of the subject is linked to the existence of an operation that is both determined and present; in each case, the subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation (he who establishes the definition of a straight line is also he who states it; he who posits the existence of a finite series is also, and at the same time, he who states it) ; and in each case, the subject links, by means of this operation and the statement in which it is embodied , his future statements and operations (as an enunciating subject, he accepts this statement as his own law). 94-95

If a proposition, a sentence, a group of signs can be called 'statement' , it is not therefore because, one day, someone happened to speak them or put them into some concrete form of writing; it is because the position of the subject can be assigned. 95

And the statement not only needs this materiality; its materiality is not given to it, in addition , once all its determinations have been fixed : it is partly made up of this materiality. 100

Yet the materiality plays a much more important role in the statement: it is not simply a principle of variation, a modification of the criteria of recog­ nition, or a determination oflinguistic sub-groups. It is constitutive of the statement itself: a statement must have a substance, a support, a place, and
a date.101

What, then, is this rule of repeatable materiality that characterizes the statement? 102

The rule of materiality that statements necessarily obey is therefore of the order of the institution rather than of the spatio-temporal localization; it defines possibilities of re-inscription and transcription (but also thresholds and limits) , rather than limited and perishable individualities. 103

Instead of being something said once and for all - and lost in the past like the result of a battle, a geological catastrophe, or the death of a king - the statement, as it emerges in its materiality, appears with a status, enters various net­ works and various fields of use, is subjected to transferences or modifications, is integrated into operations and strategies in which its identity is maintained or effaced.105

I now realize that I could not define the statement as a unit of a linguistic type (superior to the phenomenon of the word, inferior to the text); but that I was dealing with an enunciative function that involved various units (these may sometimes be sentences, sometimes propositions; but they are sometimes made up of fragments of sentences , series or tables of signs, a set of propositions or equivalent formulations); and, instead of giving a 'meaning' to these units, this function relates them to a field of objects; instead of providing them with a subject, it opens up for them a number of possible subjective positions; instead of fixing their limits, it places them in a domain of coordination and coexistence; instead of determining their identity, it places them in a space in which they are used and repeated. In short, what has been discovered is not the atomic statement - with its apparent meaning, its origin, its limits, and its individuality - but the operational field of the enunciative function and the conditions according to which it reveals various units (which may be, but need not be, of a grammatical or logical order) .  106

We are studying statements at the limit that separates them from what is not said, in the occurrence that allows them to emerge to the exclusion of all others. 119

In examining the statement what we have discovered is a function that has a bearing on groups of signs, which is identified neither with grammatical 'acceptability' nor with logical correctness, and which requires if it is to operate : a referential (which is not exactly a fact, a state of things , or even an object, but a principle of differentiation) ; a subject (not the speaking consciousness, not the author of the formulation, but a position that may be filled in certain conditions by various individuals) ; an associated field (which is not the real context of the formulation , the situation in which it was articulated, but a domain of coexistence for other statements) ; a materialityr (which is not only the substance or support of the articulation, but a status, rules of transcription, possibilities of use and re-use) .115

We shall call discourse a group of statements in so far as they belong to the same discursive formation; it does not form a rhetorical or formal unity, endlessly repeatable, whose appearance or use in history might be indicated (and, if necessary, explained) ; it is made up of a limited number of statements for which a group of conditions of existence can be defined.117

what we have called 'discursive practice' can now be defined more precisely. It must not be confused with the expressive operation by which an individual formulates an idea, a desire, an image; nor with the rational activity that may operate in a system of inference; nor with the 'competence' of a speaking subject when he constructs grammatical sentences; it is a body of anonymous, historical rules, always determined in the time and space that have defined a given period, and for a given social, economic, geographical, or linguistic area, the conditions of operation of the enunciative function. 117

There is no sub-text. And therefore no plethora. The enunciative domain is identical with its own surface. Each statement occupies in it a place that belongs to it alone. The description of a statement does not consist therefore in rediscovering the unsaid whose place it occupies; nor how one can reduce it to a silent, common text; but on the contrary in discovering what special place it occupies, what ramifications of the system of formations make it possible to map its localization, how it is isolated in the general dispersion of statements . 119 

Because statements are rare, they are collected in unifying totalities, and the meanings to be found in them are multiplied. 120

To describe a group of statements not as the closed, plethoric totality of a meaning, but as an incomplete, fragmented figure; to describe a group of statements not with reference to the interiority of an intention, a thought, or a subject, but in accordance with the dispersion of an exteriority; to describe a group of statements, in order to rediscover not the moment or the trace of their origin, but the specific forms of an accumulation, is certainly not to uncover an interpretation, to discover a foundation, or to free constituent acts; nor is it to decide on a rationality, or to embrace a teleology. It is to establish what I am quite willing to call a positivity. 125

# Archaeology

Archaeology describes discourses as practices specified in the element of the archive. 131

Archaeology - and this is one of its principal themes - may thus constitute the tree of derivation of a discourse. 147

On the contrary, its purpose is to map, in a particular discursive practice, the point at which they are constituted, to define the form that they assume, the relations that they have with each other, and the domain that they govern. In short, its purpose is to maintain discourse in all its many irregularities; and consequently to suppress the theme of a contradiction uniformly lost and rediscovered, resolved and forever rising again, in the undifferentiated element of the Logos. 155-156

the positivities that I have tried to establish must not be understood as a set of determinations imposed from the outside on the thought of individuals, or inhabiting it from the inside, in advance as it were; they constitute rather the set of conditions in accordance with which a practice is exercised, in accordance with which that practices gives rise to partially or totally new statements, and in accordance with which it can be modified. These positivities are no so much limitations imposed on the initiative of subjects as the field in which that initiative is articulated 208-209

What it seeks in the texts of Linnaeus or Buffon, Petty or Ricardo, Pinel or Bichat, is not to draw up a list of founding saints; it is to uncover  the regularity of a discursive practice. A practice that is in operation, in the same way, in the work of their predecessors; a practice that takes account in their work not only of the most original affirmations (those that no one else dreamt of before them), but also of those that they borrowed, even copied, from their predecessors. A discovery is no less regular, from the enunciative point of view, than the text that repeats and diffuses it; regularity is no less operant, no less effective and active, in a banal as in a unique formation 144-145

In relation to a history of ideas that attempts to melt contradictions in the semi-nocturnal unity of an overall figure, or which attempts to transmute them into a general, abstract, uniform principle of interpretation or explanation, archaeology describes the different spaces of dissension. 152

Archaeological analysis, then, erects the primacy of a contradiction that has its model in the simultaneous affirmation and negation of a single proposition. 155

Discursive formations can be identified, therefore, neither as sciences, nor as scarcely scientific disciplines, nor as distant prefigurations of the sciences to come, nor as forms that exclude any scientificity from the outset. 181

This group of elements, formed in a regular manner by a discursive practice, and which are indispensable to the constitution of a science, although they are not necesssarily destined to give to one, can be called _knowledge_. Knowledge is that on which one can speak in a discursive practice, and which is specified by that fact 182

any discursive practice may be defined by the knowledge that it forms. 183

we should distinguish carefully between _scientific domains_ and _archaeological territories_ 183

Knowledge is not an epistemological site that disappears in the science that supersedes it. Science (or what is offered as such) is localized in a field of knowledge and plays a role in it. A role that varies according to discursive formation, and is modified with their mutations. 184

Instead of exploring the consciousness/knowledge (_connaissance_)/science axis (which cannot escape subjectivity), archaeology explores the discursive practice/knowledge (_savoir_)/science axis. ... archaeology finds the point of balance of its analysis in _savoir_ -- that is, in a domain in which the subject is necessarily situated and dependent, and can never figure as titular (either as a transcendental activity, or as empirical consciousness). 183

In any discursive formation, one finds a specific relation between science and knowledge; and instead of defining between them a relation of exclusion or subtraction (...), archaeological analysis must show positively how a science functions in the element of knowledge. 185


The moment at which a discursive practice achieves individuality and autonomy, the moment therefore at which a single system for the formation of statements is put into operation, or the moment at which this system is transformed, might be called the threshold of positivity. 186

In seeking the level of discursive practice in the historical density of the sciences, one is not trying to place discursive practice at some deep, original level, one is not trying to place it at the level of lived experience (on this earth, which is given, irregular and fragmented, before all geometry; in the heaven that glitters through the grid of all astronomies); one is trying to reveal between positivities, knowledge, epistemological figures, and sciences, a whole set of differences, relations, gaps, shifts, independencies, autonomies, and the way in which they articulate their own historicities on one another. 191


Archaeological analysis would have another aim: it would try to discover whether space, distance, depth, colour, light, proportions, volumes and contours were not, at the period in question, considered, named, enunciated and conceptualised in a discursive practice; and whether the knowledge that this discursive practice gives rise to was not embodied perhaps in theories and speculations, in forms of teaching and codes of practice, but also in processes, techniques, and even in the very gesture of the painter. ... It is shot through ... with the positivity of a knowledge (_savoir_) 194-194


There is perhaps only one science for which one can neither distinguish these different thresholds, nor describe a similar set of shifts : mathematics, the only discursive practice to have crossed at one and the same time the thresholds of positivity, epistemologization, scientificity, and formalization. The very possibility of its existence implied that which, in all other sciences, remains dispersed throughout history, should be given at the outset : its original positivity was to constitute an already formalized discursive practice (even if other formalizations were to be used later) .188

What archaeology tries to describe is not the specific structure of science, but the very different domain of _knowledge_ 195

because of a gradient that no doubt characterizes our cultures, discursive formations are constantly becoming epistemologized. 195
