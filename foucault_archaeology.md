instead of referring back to the synthesis or the unifying function of a subject, the various enunciative modalities manifest his dispersion 54

Lastly, a graph, a growth curve, an age pyramid, a distribution cloud are all statements 82

To describe a group of statements not as the closed, plethoric totality of a meaning, but as an incomplete, fragmented figure; to describe a group of statements not with reference to the interiority of an intention, a thought, or a subject, but in accordance with the dispersion of an exter­ iority; to describe a group of statements, in order to rediscover not the moment or the trace of their origin, but the specific forms of an accumula­ tion, is certainly not to uncover an interpretation, to discover a founda­ tion, or to free constituent acts; nor is it to decide on a rationality, or to embrace a teleology. It is to establish what I am quite willing to call a positivity. 125

the positivities that I have tried to establish must not be understood as a set of determinations imposed from the outside ont he thought of individuals, or inhabiting it from the inside, in advance as it were; they constitute rather the set of conditions in accordance with which a practice is exercised, in accordance with which that practices gives rise to partially or totally new statements, and in accordance with which it can be modified. These positivities are no so much limitations imposed on the initiative of subjects as the field in which that initiative is articulated 208-209

Discursive formations can be identified, therefore, neither as sciences, nor as scarcely scientific disciplines, nor as distant prefigurations of the sciences to come, nor as forms that exclude any scientificity from the outset. 181

This group of elements, formed in a regular manner by a discursive practice, and which are indispensable to the constitution of a science, although they are not necesssarily destined to give to one, can be called _knowledge_. Knowledge is that on which one can speak in a discursive practice, and which is specified by that fact 182

any discursive practice may be defined by the knowledge that it forms. 183

we should distinguish carefully between _scientific domains_ and _archaeological territories_ 183

Knowledge is not an epistemological site that disappears in the science that supersedes it. Science (or what is offered as such) is localized in a field of knowledge and plays a role in it. A role that varies according to discursive formation, and is modified with their mutations. 184

In any discursive formation, one finds a specific relation between science and knowledge; and instead of defining between them a relation of exclusion or subtraction (...), archaeological analysis must show positively how a science functions in the element of knowledge. 185

Instead of exploring the consciousness/knowledge (_connaissance_)/science axis (which cannot escape subjectivity), archaeology explores the discursive practice/knowledge (_savoir_)/science axis. ... archaeology finds the point of balance of its analysis in _savoir_ -- that is, in a domain in which the subject is necessarily situated and dependent, and can never figure as titular (either as a transcendental activity, or as empirical consciousness). 183


In seeking the level of discursive practice in the historical density of the sciences, one is not trying to place discursive practice at some deep, original level, one is not trying to place it at the level of lived experience (on this earth, which is given, irregular and fragmented, before all geometry; in the heaven that glitters through the grid of all astronomies); one is trying to reveal between positivities, knowledge, epistemological figures, and sciences, a whole set of differences, relations, gaps, shifts, independencies, autonomies, and the way in which they articulate their own historicities on one another. 191

Archaeological analysis would have another aim: it would try to discover where space, distance, depth, colour, light, proportions, volumes and contours were not, at the period in question, considered, named, enunciated and conceptualised in a discursive practice; and whether the knowledge that this discursive practice gives rise to was not embodied perhaps in theories and speculations, in forms of teaching and codes of practice, but also in processes, techniques, and even in the very gesture of the painter. ... It is short through ... with the positivity of a knowledge (_savoir_) 194-194

What archaeology tries to describe is not the specific structure of science, but the very different domain of _knowledge_ 195

because of a gradient that no doubt characterizes our cultures, discursive formations are constantly becoming epistemologized. 195
