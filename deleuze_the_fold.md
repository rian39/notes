But the essence of the Baroque entails neither falling into nor emerging from illusion but rather realizing  something in illusion itself. 125

ch2: folds in the soul
Inflection becomes vortical, and at the same its variation opens onto fluctuation, it becomes fluctuation. 17

The definition of Baroque mathematics is born with Leibniz. The object of the discipline is a 'new affection' of variable sizes, which variation itself. 17

the presence of a curved element acts as a cause 17
Just as the object becomes objectile, the subject becomes a superject 20
The truth of a variation appears to a subject. This is the very idea of Baroque perspective. 20

relation between continuum and contiguous – no contradiction 20
PoV → distances
PoV → power of arranging cases 21

inhesion: from inflection to inclusion: the final cause of the fold – to envelop in something else. 22

The point of inflection, the point of position, and the point of inclusion will thus be distinguished 23

the world is the infinite curve that touches at an infinity of points an infinity of curves, the curve with a unique variable, the convergent series of all series 24

the soul is the expression of the world (actuality), but because the world is what the soul expresses (virtuality). 26

The painting-window is replaced by tabulation, the grid on which lines, numbers and changing characters are inscribed (the objectile). 27

Leibniz's monad would be just such a grid – or better, a room or an apartment – completely covered with lines of variable inflection 27

For Leibniz, the monad is clearly the most “simple” number, that is, the inverse, reciprocal, harmonic number. It is the mirror of the world because it is the inverted image of God, the inverse number of infinity. 129

The inverse number has special traits: it is infinite or infinitely small, but also, by opposition to the natural number, which is collective, it is individual and distributive. 129

Each monad includes the world as infinite series of infinitely small units, but establishes differential relations and integrations only upon a limited portion of the series, such that the monads themselves enter in an infinite series of inverse numbers. 130
