far from losing its relevance in the shift to the population as the locus of power, the level of the individual—again meaning the flux of individual elements and behaviors—is precisely the site for the individualization of variables that, in aggregate, form the concrete content of the population at any given moment. 517

It is precisely here—in relation to the probabilistic calculus opened by populations—that I would situate the potential of Foucault’s work as a resource for the media theorist. The core of this potential centers on the homology between governance’s probabilistic control over individual experience and twenty-­first-­century media’s direct or subconscious impact on preindividual sensory life. In both cases, the “phenomena” at issue for individual experience cannot appear to consciousness, or more precisely and more generally, they do not have any coherence at the level of individual self-­ reference; in both cases, that is, the phenomena at issue must be mediated through a larger process of individuation that both constitutes experience in the form of an effect and gives access to it. 521 {#probability} {#experience} {#platform-positive}
