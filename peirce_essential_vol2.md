An _icon_ is a sign which stands for its object because as a thing perceived it excites an idea naturally allied to the idea that object excite. ... A diagram is a kind of icon particularly useful, because it suppresses a quantity of details, and so allows the mind to more easily to think of the important features. ... Many diagrams resemble their objects not all in their looks; it is only in respect to the relations of their parts that their likeness consists. 13 'Of Reasoning in General'


When, in algebra, we write equations under one another in a regular array, especially when we put resembling letters for corresponding coefficients, the array is an icon. Here is an example:
$$a_1x + b_1Y == n_1$$
$$a_2x + b_2Y == n_2$$
This is an icon, in that it makes quantities look alike which are in analogous relations to the problem. Every algebraical equation is an icon, in so far as it *exhibits*, by means of the algebraical signs (which are not themselves icons), the relations of the quantities concerned. 13 'Reasoning in General'


Now mathematical reasoning is diagrammatic. This is as true of algebra as of geometry. But in order to discern the features of diagrammatic reasoning, it is requisite to begin with examples that are not too simple. In simple cases, the essential features are often so nearly obliterated that they can only be discerned when one knows what to look for. 206

We not only have to select the features of the diagram which it will be pertinent to pay attention to, but it is also of great importance to return again and again to certain features. ... But the greatest point of art consists in the introduction of suitable _abstractions_. By this I mean such a transformation of our diagrams that characters of one diagram may appear in another as things. A familiar example is where in analysis we treat operations as themselves the subject of operations. 212-213 (The Nature of Meaning)

A _diagram_ is an _icon_ or schematic image embodying the meaning of a general predicate; and from the observation of this _icon_ we are supposed to construct a new general predicate. 'New Elements' 303

This resolution is of the nature of a plan, or, as one might say, a _diagram_. 246 'What makes a reasoning sound?'

##On the logic of drawing history from ancient documents

the theory of probabilities has been called the logic of the modern exact sciences; and it is known to be the basis of the vast business of insurance; and therefore when a literary man learns that the method which he has been pursuing has the sanction of such a great mathematical doctrine, he begins to feel that he is a very scientific person 80-81
