Gell, A. (1998). Art and agency : an anthropological theory. Oxford, Clarendon Press.

[W]e can imagine the artist's ouvere, at the macro-scale, as one indivisible work, consisting of many physical indexes (works) but amounting to a single temporal entity, like a persistent thunderstorm  which is made up of many, quasi-instantaneous, flashes of lightning. The artist's oeuvre is an object which, so to speak, is made out of time; not the tenuous, dimensional time of physics  (...), but the kind of substantialized time which Bergson named durée. Bergsonian  durée, a model for which is provided by biological evolution regarded as a teleonomic process rather than as a random accumulation of chance mutations, has no significance for the physicist, but that is not to say that   durée  has no psychological or cognitive validity as a concept. 236

In other words, the temporal structure of index-to-index relations in the artists' oeuvre externalizes or objectifies the same type of relations as exist between the artists internal states of mind as a being endowed with consciousness.
