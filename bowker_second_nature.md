Bowker, Geoffrey C. 1995  “Second Nature Once Removed. Time, space and representations”, Time and Society vol 4(1):47-66[]4.

It is unproblematic to say that societies with differing configurations of economic and technological development have differing ways of understanding and representing time and space. The problem begins when one tries to move out from this statement in any direction. (Bowker, 1995, 47)

My argument will be that  by looking at infrastructural technology and organization we can discover a missing link between political economy (in the broadest sense of  the term, as the general form of the interaction between society and nature at a given epoch) and the representational time and space that came to be used across the board in bureaucratic work and in human and natural sciences.  (Bowker, 1995, 48)

One could perhaps describe globalization as an inevitably ever-incomplete attempt to impose a uniform representational time and space on a heterogeneous collection of lived spaces and histories.  (Bowker, 1995, 55)

Railways were uniquely important in the nineteenth century because of the interconnection of  two innovations. Railway technology created physically a new landscape-marked by the free flow of massive physical objects on a straight line. The smells and touch of the local environment did not exist in the abstract landscape the traveler sensed (...); only quantities (time, distance, mass) did. Equally importantly, the railroads represented their own organization within this abstract space and time. They imposed a standard, administrative time on the countries they operated in. They developed organizational flow charts and command systems that traced out the contours of this abstract space.  (Bowker, 1995, 61)

I have collectively labeled such convergences (map/territory; human/non-human) bureaucratic convergence, to underline the organization work that was involved in operating them. (Bowker, 1995, 62)
