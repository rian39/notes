Perhaps the most important achievement of UNIX is to demonstrate that a powerful operating system for interactive use need not be expensive either in equipment or in human effort: UNIX can be run on hardware costing as little as $40,000, and less than two man-years were spent on the main system software (Ritchie & Thompson, 1974, 365).
