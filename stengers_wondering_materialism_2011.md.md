# Wondering about materialism
The thesis I am defining – that materialism should be divorced from (academic) eliminativism in order to connect with struggle – does not deny that elimination may have been utterly relevant, when it entailed struggling against the allied powers of state and church, for instance. Today, however, the situation has changed. Elimination has become the very tool of power. It is not only a tool for capitalism, but also for what I could call, together with Hilary Rose, 'bad science'. 370

I propose as a materialist motto: we never get a relevant answer if our practices have not enabled us to produce a relevant question 373

What is at stake in a practice, in any practice, cannot be reduced to the generality of a human socially organized activity. 375

Celebrating the exceptional character of the experimental achievement very effectively limits the claims made in the name of science. 376

Taking seriously the singularity of experimental practices aslo leads us to understand the strong possibility of their desutrction by the coming knowledge economy. The points is not that the scientific etnerprise would lose a neutrality it never had.  … What is at risk is rather the very social fabric of scientific reliability, that is, the constitutive relation between an epxerimental achievmenet and the gathering of what can be called 'competent colleagues' 377

with the knowledge economy, we may have scientists at work everywhere, producing acts with the speed that new sophisticated inustruments make possible, but that the way those facets are interpreted will now molsty follow the landscape of settled interests.  In other words, the deconstructivist-eliminativist view will then be fully verified. We will more and more deal with instrumental knowledge. 377

We live in a cemetery of destroyed practices. 

The nostalgia of a conceptual solution 379



the challenge, which I deem a materialist challenge, is that whatever the mess and perplexity that may result, we should resist the temptation to pick and choose among practices 379
