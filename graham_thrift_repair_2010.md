consider all the processes of maintenance and repair that keep modern societies going. These processes can be likened to the social equivalent of the humble earthworm in their remorseless and necessary character – and in the way in which they have been neglected by nearly all commentators as somehow beneath their notice. 1

Things only come into visible focus as things when they become inoperable – they break or stutter and they then become the object of attention. The background is thereby foregrounded. 2 

in this space between breakdown and restoration of the practical equilibrium – between the visible (that is, ‘broken’) tool and the concealed tool – that repair and maintenance, makes its bid for significance. For without that capacity, the world cannot go on, cannot become ready-to-hand again. 3

the many processes of maintenance and repair as an illustration of the power of things to form a common material substrate, which is always on and which forms the equivalent of a Heideggerian background 4 

When breakdowns and malfunctions occur, it is not necessarily the case that they can be easily fixed. The reason for the breakdown may be opaque (especially as technological systems become more complex), the restoration may be too urgent for usual channels and procedures to be followed, the replacement parts may not be quite right but need to be made to fit. 4

Improvisation allows the work of maintenance and repair to go on when things may seem bleak and it takes in a whole series of responses, from simple repetition (such as trying it again) through to attempts to improve communication so as to be clear exactly what the problem is, through disagreement over causes, through to complex theorizing, responses which are often the result of long and complex apprenticeships and other means of teaching (Henke, 2000; Suchman, 1987)  4

To summarize the argument so far, perhaps we have been looking in the wrong place. Perhaps we should have been looking at breakdown and failure as no longer atypical and therefore only worth addressing if they result in catastrophe and, instead, at breakdown and failure as the means by which societies learn and learn to re-produce 5 {#breakdown} {#work}

And, if this is the case, then the multifarious activities of repair and maintenance become not just secondary and derivative but pivotal. They become one of our chief means of seeing and understanding the world. 5 {#method} {#breakdown}

To summarize once more, the problem with contemporary social theory is that it has predominantly theorized connection and assembly. But there are good reasons to think that, in the overall scheme of things, disconnection and disassembly are just as important in that they resist entities’ means of enacting themselves: failure is key. 7 {#breakdown} {#network} {#making} {#platform-positive}

First, the very fact that certain technosocial complexes emerge that are deemed to be ‘infrastructure’ often works to undermine their cultural visi- bility. This veiling of the multitudinous technological circuits of the city as standardized, normalized and immanent ‘infrastructure’ thus tends to work to deflect attention from cities of repair. 8

attention to the need for repair and maintenance of infrastructures tends only to occur after catastrophic, rather than prosaic failures. 9

the inherent and continuous unreliabilities within all infra- structure systems, which necessitate continuous efforts of repair and main- tenance to actually allow them to sustain the distantiated connections and flows that they are designed to deliver, still tend to be rendered invisible both culturally and analytically. 10 

In most of the mega-cities of the global South, for example, the fact that urban life is the result of continuous efforts of infrastructural improvisation and repair is too overwhelming and visible to be ignored. ... Endless improvisation surrounds the distribution of scarce water, sanitation, communications, Internet, energy and transport services existing beyond the limited confines of officially sanctioned or contracted users. Many economic sectors are dominated by the question of how the modern and ‘competitive’ business and logistics modes demanded by transnational economic integration and logistics chains can be sustained against a background of unreliable, patchy and continu-
ously interrupted infrastructure supply 11

Automobile accidents are often personal catastrophes but they are normal facts of everyday urban life and, as if to illustrate this point, they are surrounded by a large and continu- ous infrastructure, from ambulances, fire services, hospitals and the car repairers just discussed, through police and motorway patrols to tow trucks and insurance assessors. They also involve a large range of skills, from forensic photography to the knowledge of how to run teams consisting of actors from many different emergency services 17. 


a major research challenge in the social sciences currently is to re-imagine economies and places in ways which, to adopt Susan Leigh-Star’s term, manage to ‘surface the invisible work’ (1999: 385) of maintenance and repair that continuously surrounds infrastructural connection, movement and flow. Maintenance and repair is an ongoing process, but it can be designed in many different ways in order to produce many different outcomes and these outcomes can be more or less effica- cious: there is, in other words, a politics of repair and maintenance. 17

The politics of repair also emerges in a host of other arenas: the wages, conditions, locations and hours of repair work (many of the poorest people are concentrated in maintenance and repair jobs, like cleaning of various kinds); the politics of knowledge of repair (with the constant effort currently being made by many firms to deskill repairers and to transfer their knowl- edge into software; see Head, 2003; Henke, 2000); 18 

First, many modern commodities are deliberately designed so that the possibilities of maintenance and repair are foreclosed (Verbeek, 2004). They lack any kind of transparency so that their functioning cannot be restored if they break down. This applies all the way from simple elec- trical plugs and power adapters, which are tightly sealed, to increasingly modular computer systems, through to motor car electronics, which can only be worked on in a specially equipped garage by mechanics who use diagnostic programs to slot in new circuit boards: 18

many increasingly sophisticated commodities are actually made to be replaced and disposed of through accelerating cycles of acqui- sition and almost immediate disposal. This results in obvious ecological problems to do with the generation, transportation and disposal or recycling of waste. Thus, in modern developed countries, most products are thrown away long before they have reached the end of their useful life, even though they could have been repaired. 18

A continuous and massive transfer is occurring of unwanted and often virtually new electronic equipment, which flows ‘downhill on an economic path of least resistance’, from the major cities of the global North to the processing spaces of Asia, Africa and Latin America (Shabi, 2002: 36). Most E-Waste is currently dumped ‘offshore’ in low-wage locations to be picked apart for precious and trace metals by tens of thousands of men, women and children, working in extremely dangerous conditions. 19

Repair and maintenance are not incidental activities. In many ways, they are the engine room of modern economies and societies. As such, they form a challenge to our ways of thinking about things which is more than just an expression of their supposedly passive and banal presence. For what we see is that repair and maintenance are vital parts of the relays of everyday life which involve their own forms of sending (Siegert, 1999). Without them, life would be impossible. Rather like the postal system, they form a minimal discourse of commands, dates, addresses, manuals, storage and feedback which whispers the world into existence.
