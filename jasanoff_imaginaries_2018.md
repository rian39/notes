national sociotechnical imaginaries are “collectively imagined forms of social life and social order reflected in the design and fulfillment of nation- specific scientific and/or technological projects” (4)

Imaginaries, moreover, encode not only visions of what is attainable through science and technology but also of how life ought, or ought not, to be lived; in this respect they express a society’s shared under- standings of good and evil. (4)

The concept helps explain a number of otherwise troublesome problems: why do tech- nological trajectories diverge across polities and periods; what makes some sociotechnical arrangements more durable than others; how do facts and technologies transcend and reconstruct time and space; and what roles do science and technology play in connecting the individual’s subjective self- understanding to a shared social or moral order? (5)

when does it make sense to invoke sociotechnical imaginaries and what methods and sources are most appropriate for identifying these constructs and their constitutive elements? (5)

the turn from a purely mentalist notion of the imagination as fantasy to imagination as organized work and practices (8)

Bringing performance back into the landscape of political theory helps re- position science and technology as key sites for the constitution of modern social imaginaries. (10) 

Performances of statehood in modernity are increasingly tied to demonstrations and to public proofs employing scientific and tech- nological instruments; equally, however, acts of popular resistance, from ter- rorist attacks to Wikileaks, draw on the same repertoires of technoscientific imagination and instrumental action. 10

To understand order and, its obverse, disorder in contemporary societies, we need an encompassing theoretical framework that draws together our scientifically and culturally conditioned perceptions of reality, our capacity to create new collectives through technological as well as social means, and the changes in expectation that arise when science and technology interact with individual self- awareness and the sense of being well ruled. 14

In this book, we argue that imagination, a crucial reservoir of power and action, lodges in the hearts and minds of human agents and institutions, although imagination’s skilled implementation requires putting in play the intricate networks whose construction has been the stuff of so much STS analysis. 17

Sociotechnical imaginaries occupy the theoretically undeveloped space between the idealistic collective imaginations identified by social and po- litical theorists and the hybrid but politically neutered networks or assemblages with which STS scholars often describe reality. 19

Discourse shares with imaginaries the properties of being collective and systemic (e.g., Hajer 1995), but it usually focuses on language and is less directly associated with action and performance or with materialization through technology. 20

A better balance needs to be struck between the theoretical poles of abstract idealism and deterministic materi- alism. By turning to sociotechnical imaginaries, we can engage directly with the ways in which people’s hopes and desires for the future— their sense of self and their passion for how things ought to be— get bound up with the hard stuff of past achievements, whether the material infrastructures of roads, power plants, and the security state or the normative infrastructures of constitutional principles, juridical practices, and public reason (22) 

The methods best suited to studying sociotechnical imaginaries therefore are the methods of interpretive research and analysis that probe the nature of structure- agency relationships through inquiries into meaning making. 24

Perhaps the most indispensable method for studying sociotechnical imaginaries is comparison. Comparing across social and political structures not only helps to identify the content and contours of sociotechnical imagi- naries but also avoids the intellectual trap of taking as universal epistemic and ethical assumptions that turn out, on investigation, to be situated and particular.24 

An imaginary is neither cause nor effect in a conventional sense but rather a continually rearticulated awareness of order in social life (Jasanoff 2012b) and a resulting commitment to that order’s coherence and continuity. 26

We take comparison, in all its forms, to be a foundational technique, recognizing that comparison can operate across all kinds of organizational variables: political across na- tions and actors; historical through time; geographic in relation to space; economic across sectors; and cultural between groups and societies. His- torical research in our view is essential to the exploration of imaginaries: it is only by following ideas through time that one gains a feel for what is fixed and what is changeable in social self- understandings as well as the reasons why. 28 


Regardless of the methods by which, and the sites in which, they are stud- ied, sociotechnical imaginaries allow us to explore more thoroughly and understand more completely some of the most basic elements of human welfare. These include, most centrally, questions about the stability, dura- bility, and coherence of social arrangements, all the more pressing in the postmodern condition, which has sensitized us to the contingency (Hacking 1999), fluidity, and chaos that often lap at the margins of achieved order. 29
