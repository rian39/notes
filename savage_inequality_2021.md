‘The standard principles of statistical testing were elaborated as procedures to draw causal inferences from analyses of distinct, standalone data sets, usually survey based.9 However, the repeated revelation of similar or consistent patterns across numerous comparable cases—­such as ­those presented in The Spirit Level—­seeks to establish causality through repetition. This form of explanation is commonplace in the humanities, notably in history. Historians extrapolate from a large battery of sources, drawing the most likely inferences from what­ever sources are available, rather than establishing causality from the application of inferential statistical procedures on singular sources. This approach is consistent with large-­ scale, symphonic comparison, involving the narrative unpacking of patterns, often using visual motifs, which in­equality researchers have championed.10 It is also a method that unites sensitivities from the humanities and the ­social sciences.' 111


Merry (2016) has examined how the construction of composite indexes has become such a rife industry in the aftermath of Millennium Development Goals, and points to the politi­cal and intellectual compromises entailed by such well-­intentioned work. Her study of the construction of composite indexes on gender violence, sex trafficking, and ­human rights reveals the tensions between statisticians drawn to commensurable mea­sures versus advocates and campaigners attuned to the specific contexts of gender vio­lence 117

big discussion of how categories were used to create groups


Race, interspersed with ethnic and religious affiliations, was the axial classic categorical divide for modernizing imperial capitalist socie­ties. This is clearly evident in the American case, as illustrated in Figure 6.1. One crude but telling indication of this is the frequency of deliberate genocidal killings of groups based on racial / ethnic / religious lines that has systematically occurred throughout modernity—­most tragically, of course, in the Nazi holocaust, but this is only one instance among many. 178

Gender formed the second classic divide in nineteenth-­century imperial modernity. Numerous feminists have taken issue with the standard sociological view that women were subordinated in “traditional societies” and that the forces of modernity broke down such traditional gender divisions through a greater attention to individual rights (for example, Federici 2004, 2012; Mies 1998). Silvia Federici emphasizes that ­women’s subordination was not a traditional feudal throwback but was itself generated in new and intense forms by the transition to modern capitalism. 180

society, with a distinct set of stakes in a shared community.
Class therefore became a more significant divide in periods when imperial expansion was under strain, when nation-­building projects came to the fore, and where racial and ethnic divisions ­were not internally strong enough to become the prime focus of elite boundary drawing. 183

Iverson and Soskice 2019). As productivity became central to capital accumulation, so classic categorical distinctions were overlain by probabilistic ones in which the differential capacities of vari­us groups to be fully engaged in productive ­labor became central. In addition, the broader sphere of so- cial reproduction in education, health, welfare, politics, and culture, which could facilitate ­these efforts, became more central. This was the moment when field dynamics ­were consolidated. And in this organ­ization of relation- ships within bounded national spaces, the delineation of the relative chances of dif­fer­ent groups took on a more pressing role. 185

During the twentieth c­entury, the classic differentiation between the “civilized” and the “­others”—­those within and without—­which predominated in imperial capitalism became overlain by differentiations specifying the “unequal chances” of various social groups in an increasingly codified and organized national space. In this process, the burgeoning expertise of social science played a key role. The Belgian statistician Adolphe Quetelet186 elaborated how the normal distribution allowed an elaboration of central tendency from which variation and thereby deviance could be measured. Through this means, normality could be established statistically and could also be associated with being “ordinary” and “typical” in a bounded national population (see generally Goldthorpe 2000). 186

As nation-states became institutionalized, they came to rely more heavily on social scientific expertise, which proliferated around the delineation, mapping, and codifying of various population groups (for example, see Dirks 2001; Mitchell 2002; Igo 2007; and Savage 2010). In his pioneering account Mitchell (2002) argued that social science expertise, notably that applied by the British in the Egyptian imperial context, elaborated concepts of the economy as some kind of autonomous sphere. 186

This social science could endeavor to reveal how such categories as class, gender, race, and ethnicity actually affected lifechances across numerous domains. This took the rendering of categorical divides away from looser cultural and moral inflections and placed them on a more measurable—­and hence putatively more scientific—­basis. Martin and Yeung (2003) relate how the variable of “race” became ubiquitous in American sociology by the end 187 of the twentieth ­century, but also how this normally merely meant treating it as a control variable with ­little or no attention to race as a specific property. This mode of “variable-based” analysis became so mainstream in the ­later twentieth ­century and early twenty-­first ­century quantitative social science that we need to remind ourselves that it is ­really a very odd way of construing the social world. This objection has been made most forcefully by Chicago sociologist Andrew Abbott (1992), who argues that the delineation of variables like this cannot help but slip into imparting agency—­causal properties—to rarefied categories as if they have some kind of in­de­pen­dent existence outside the specific mea­sure­ment tools and context in which they are elaborated. Whereas classic categories ordered agency to dif­fer­ent groups by distinguishing a forward-­looking insider group against outsider groups mired somehow in the past, ­these new variable-­centered and probabilistic categories denied agency to anyone. ­These categories ­were now defined as abstract variables able to produce effects—as could be revealed by skilled multivariate analysis 188s

This relativization of categorical inequalities was part and parcel of the growing “methodological nationalism,” in which the relative differences between categories could be delineated by being arrayed in autonomous national space with clear and definite geographical bound­areas inside which life chances could be measured. 194 The shift ­toward lower inequality regimes during the twentieth ­century is to be understood as tied up with the rise of nation spaces and the probabilistic rendering of the stuff of inequality. This reflects a world mired by the relativization of categorical groups seen as comprising differing national opportunity structures. Public services around the globe seek to identify and modulate (though not always with ­wholehearted commitment) these probabilistic inequalities. Corporations and employers of all kinds evaluate their members’ categorical characteristics so as to manage equal opportunities—­not always very successfully. This current has ushered in a way of thinking about in­equality between groups not in terms of their intrinsic properties, but in terms of the relative advantages or disadvantages that they experience. This idea that in­equality is to be understood probabilistically is now utterly ubiquitous, almost to the extent that it is a truism. However, we should not see this framing as inevitable or necessary. 194-195

## Visceral inequality

Race was the primary classic categorical divide at the onset of imperial modernity. This was most evidently marked by the inhuman institution of racialized slavery and the brutal treatment of indigenous populations. It continues to be the most obdurate categorical division. Racial inequalities have in some spheres become more prominent. This is therefore different from class and gender, where economic inequalities have become more attenuated. Whereas the relative gender pay gap has substantially reduced, the racial pay gap has changed little, if at all. 215

Racial inequalities therefore proliferate as old imperial divides are compounded by the racialization of immigration. In this light, we can better un derstand the power of Black Lives Matter and resurgent antiracist campaigns. These movements change the terms of debate about racism away from a set of abstract probabilities by insisting on the lived, bodily experience, including the historical and migration roots that cannot be effaced. The reassertion of the power of slavery as a defining feature of the ongoing Black experience plays a crucial role in the American and African context. 218

By portraying prominent elite figures, marked by their wealth, power, and privilege, ­people’s relative lack can more readily be turned into anger and resentment. This is why the vis ceral inequalities experienced by ­women, racial minorities, and ­those from disadvantaged classes are not best understood as performative or identity based. They come to the fore when relative inequalities decline, so encouraging the sense that mobility should be possible—­but also when the ­actual concentration of top-level inequalities leads in the other direction. The impossibility of ever winning the game, however hard you play—­and even if you obtain a certain mea­sure of success—­becomes ever more apparent as the biggest victors forge further ahead. The overarching hold of ­those at the top who stand above you, judging you, and ultimately finding you wanting, becomes more grating. In this context, we can understand the anger expressed ­toward statues of Cecil Rhodes or General Lee not as purely symbolic struggles, or just as trying to set the historical record straight, but testify to the resurgent anger toward elites—in the form of powerful white men—­who increasingly characterize the “stuff of in­equality.”
Visceral inequalities are linked to the changing dynamics of 219


The bodies of ­those who have been brought into view by the economists’ income share analysis are very much those of white men. At the very top levels of the income distribution, among the top few ­percent who are the major beneficiaries of enhanced income and wealth, women have not moved proportionately into the highest pay brackets. This domain of the superrich remains very much a male, patriarchal world. Women remain highly under- represented among top income earners in many advanced economies (At- kinson et al. 2018), being less than 20 ­percent of ­those in the top 1 ­percent of earners in most nations. They are even more underrepresented among the top 0.1 ­percent.i 220

Therefore, in recent de­cades, the stuff of in­equality is increasingly rendered as visceral, physical, and embodied, rather than abstracted into rela tive categories. This is a far-­reaching process that generates tensions and conflicts that are increasingly virulent—­and which can be expected to be come more so. Visceral inequality recognizes the historically different mechanisms by which the stuff of in­equality is rendered, or more exactly, categorical distinctions are produced. 227
