Therefore, it is vital to realize that field dynamics also require a culmina- tion, and hence that they contain the seeds of their own dissolution. Thinking through the long-­term dynamics of fields thereby leads us to the inescap- able conclusion that the creation of a successful, autonomous field requires the production of a temporal ontology distinguishing past, pre­sent, and ­f uture, but also that this undercuts itself as the players on the field seek to conclude their striving through producing a result. 89

The rising significance of inherited capital is therefore both symptom and driver of the breakdown of modern temporal ontology. Fields of all kinds become dominated by inheritors rather than ­those who win their spurs through their own field-­specific qualities. This pro­cess should not simply be equated with the incursion of economic capital into cultural, social, and po­ liti­cal domains. Instead, this is a pro­cess of entropy, in which t­hose who succeed in any specific field tend to convert their advantages to an “objecti- fied” form that can be stored, transmitted, sold, and passed on. This usually takes the form of conversion to some kind of economic asset, which is the quin­tes­sen­tial and hegemonic way of objectifying value, and hence contrib- utes to the growing power of economic capital.93


Notwith- standing all our excitement about new gadgets, robots, and devices, we are actually increasingly in the thrall of the past. Con­temporary society is trammeled by previous rounds of accumulation that are fundamental to our now-­time. In the early twenty-­first c­ entury, history exercises a hold over the pre­sent that has not been seen for centuries. The bold revolutionary hopes—­endemic to modernity—of breaking from the past and ushering in a brave new world have been dashed. The debris of the past—­accumulated in capital, urban infrastructures, military power, venerable institutions of learning, privileged families, and blue chip companies—­now dominatesR enewing M arx 99 the social landscape.

‘The standard principles of statistical testing w ere elaborated as procedures to draw causal inferences from analyses of distinct, standalone data sets, usually survey based.9 However, the repeated revelation of similar or consistent patterns across numerous comparable cases—­such as ­those presented in The Spirit Level—­seeks to establish causality through repetition. This form of explanation is commonplace in the humanities, notably in history. Historians extrapolate from a large battery of sources, drawing the most likely inferences from what­ever sources are available, rather than establishing causality from the application of inferential statistical procedures on singular sources. This approach is consistent with large-­ scale, symphonic comparison, involving the narrative unpacking of patterns, often using visual motifs, which in­equality researchers have championed.10 It is also a method that unites sensitivities from the humanities and the ­social sciences.' 111


ally Merry (2016) has examined how the construction of composite indexes has become such a rife industry in the aftermath of Millennium Development Goals, and points to the po­ liti­cal and intellectual compromises entailed by such well-­intentioned work. Her study of the construction of composite indexes on gender vio­lence, sex trafficking, and ­human rights reveals the tensions between statisticians drawn to commensurable mea­sures versus advocates and campaigners at- tuned to the specific contexts of gender vio­lence 117
