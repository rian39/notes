Therefore, it is vital to realize that field dynamics also require a culmina-
tion, and hence that they contain the seeds of their own dissolution. Thinking
through the long-­term dynamics of fields thereby leads us to the inescap-
able conclusion that the creation of a successful, autonomous field requires
the production of a temporal ontology distinguishing past, pre­sent, and
­future, but also that this undercuts itself as the players on the field seek to
conclude their striving through producing a result. 89

The rising significance of inherited capital is therefore both symptom and
driver of the breakdown of modern temporal ontology. Fields of all kinds
become dominated by inheritors rather than ­those who win their spurs
through their own field-­specific qualities. This pro­cess should not simply be
equated with the incursion of economic capital into cultural, social, and po­
liti­cal domains. Instead, this is a pro­cess of entropy, in which t­hose who
succeed in any specific field tend to convert their advantages to an “objecti-
fied” form that can be stored, transmitted, sold, and passed on. This usually
takes the form of conversion to some kind of economic asset, which is the
quintessential and hegemonic way of objectifying value, and hence contrib-
utes to the growing power of economic capital.93

Notwith- standing all our excitement about new gadgets, robots, and devices, we are
actually increasingly in the thrall of the past. Con­temporary society is
trammeled by previous rounds of accumulation that are fundamental to
our now-­time. In the early twenty-­first c­ entury, history exercises a hold over
the pre­sent that has not been seen for centuries. The bold revolutionary
hopes—­endemic to modernity—of breaking from the past and ushering in
a brave new world have been dashed. The debris of the past—­accumulated
in capital, urban infrastructures, military power, venerable institutions of
learning, privileged families, and blue chip companies—­now dominatesR enewing M arx
