There is an interesting convergence between the world and its information at this point. Both in terms of databases on computers and the world as database, scientists are seeking for the minimum dataset which is needed in order to preserve biodiversity—whether that dataset be the genes held in organisms or the bits held in computers. In both cases this is not seen as the ideal outcome; to the contrary, it is seen as a practical choice—given that we are destroying biodiversity, and given that we do not have enough systematists 747  {#biodiversity} {#datafication}

We have just seen that there is a problem with integrating data across a range of disciplines which have two fundamentally incommensurable ontologies. A second integration problem is that data which is collected is being integrated into two discourses —a scientific and a political discourse—which operate in two different 
(overlapping but sometimes analytically distinct) sets of relations. 748

The databases being developed today do not impose a hegemonic solution: they unfurl within them, at the level of data structure and data processing algorithms, the contradictions folded into their creation. 751 {#datafication}

Each particular discipline associated with biodiversity has its own incompletely articulated series of objects, times and spaces. These objects each enfold an organiza- tional history and subtend a particular temporality or spatiality. They frequently are incompletely articulated with other objects, temporalities and spatialities—often legacy versions when drawing on non-proximat e disciplines. All this sounds like an unholy mess if one wants to produce a consistent, long-term database of biodiversity relevant information the world over. At the very least it suggests that global panoptica are not the way to go in biodiversity data! 751

To get an understanding of biodiversity data, we need to move away from a goal of producing a global panopticon, which will always be unattainable. We should instead begin to look at the practices that are productive of local orderings and alignments of datasets. 751

If we are going to develop decent biodiversity maps to inform policy then we need databases held together through more than just good metadata practice. In a biodiverse world we need to be thinking through ways of manipulating ontologically diverse data. It is surely a rich challenge to the GIS community to devise forms of representation which integrate without traducing the multiple data diversities of the  field of biodiversity. 751
