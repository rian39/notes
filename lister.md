Identity is understood as a fluid process in which 'self' and environment are constantly interacting. This idea rests upon the proposition that identity is constructed through discourse. 167


Media technologies can be seen as implicated in a shifting sense of identity in numerous ways, including the following:
through changes in mass media ...
through consumption as an active practice of bricolage, consturcted through images and consumer good we 'choose', a process perhaps given new impetus by the interactive and reproductive power of digital software;
identity can be 'constructed' in cyberspace or virtual worlds;
as individuals within virtual communities (249)

[T]he mass media have become integrated into everyday life to the extent of being in some respects constitute of sociality reality. Increasingly, the audience-public can be said to live inside 'the machine' of mass media 250
