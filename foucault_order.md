These buried similitudes must be inicated on the surface of things; there must be visible marks for the inivisble analogies. 26

language no longer consists only of representations and of sounds that in turn represent the representations and oare ordered amongh them as the links of thought requirel it consists also of formal elements, grouped into a a system, which impose upon the sounds, syllables, and roots an organization that is not that of representation. Thus an element has been introduced into the analysis of language that is not reducible to it. 235

But from now on there is an interior 'mechanism' in languages which determines not only each one's individuality but also its resemblances to the others: it is this mechanism, the bearer of identity and difference, the sign of adjacency, the mark of kinship, that is now to become the basis for history 236

representation has lost the power to provide a foundation -- with its own being, its own deployment and its power of doubling over on itself -- for the links that can join its various elements together. No composition, no decomposition, no analysis into identities and differences can now justify the connection of representations to one another; order, the table in which it is spatialized, the adjacencies it defines, the successions it authorizes as so many possible routes between points on its surface -- none of these is any longer in a position to link representations or the elements of a particular representation together 238-239

things, in their fundamental truth, have no escaped from the space of the table 239

The space of order, which served as a _common place_ for representation and for things, for empirical visibility and for the essential rules, which united the regularities of nature and the resemblances of imagination in the grid of identities and differences, which displayed the empirical sequence of representations in a simultaneous table, and made it possible to scan step by step, in accordance with a logical sequence, the totality of nature's elements thus rendered contemporaneous with one another -- this space of order is fron now on shattered: there will be things, with their own organic structures, their hidden veins, the spaces that articulates them, the time that produces them; and then representation, a purely temporal succession, in which those things address themselves (always partially) to a subjectivity ... 239-240

The entire system of grdis which analysed the sequence of representations (a thin temporal series unfolding in men's minds), arresting its movement, fragmenting it, spreading it out and redistributing it in a permanent table, all these distinctions created by words and discourse, characters and classification, equivalence and exchange, have been so completely abolished that it is difficult today to rediscover how that structure was able to function. 303-4
