Let's draw a distinction: unlike tools and art, philosophical carpentry _is built with philosophy in mind_: it may serve myriad other productive and aesthetic purposes, breaking with its origins and entering into dissemination like anything else, but it's first constructed as a theory, or an experiment, or a question -- one that can be operated. Carpentry is philosophical lab equipment. 100
