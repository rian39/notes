Shields, Rob The Virtual, Routledge, London & New York, 2003
Today's tight connection of the virtual to the digital hardware and software is a new form. It represents a return of 'the virtual' in our social activity. Some would just dismiss the term as an overused and underdefined label. However, this ironically recognises that, at a minimum, 'the virtual' is one of the most important marketing terms for the high-tech sector which is claimed to dirve the development of a putative high-tech, knowledge-oriented 'virtual society.' (19)
The virtual troubles any simple negation because it introduces multiplicity into the otherwise fixed category of the real. As such the tangible, actually real phenomenon ceases to be the sole, hegemonic examples of 'reality.' (21)
Operating with a simple notion of the tangible and the original as the one and only 'actually real' leads to a series of conundrums over anything produced from a model or in a series, such as in the case of mass production. The solution is not to debate the reality of the virtual, but to develop a more sophisticated theory of the real and the ways in which the virtual and the concrete are different really existing forms, how they are related to each other and to non-existing abstractions and probabilities. (21)
The hype around digital virtuality over the past decade has been more about myth and less about actual cyberspaces. As fad and myth, virtualism is itself virtual. (15)
