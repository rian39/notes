NOTE

The intention of this note is not to provide a presentation of O n The M ode o f
Existence o f Technical O bjects, a work that has for quite some time already become

a classic philosophical reference and is Gilbert Simondon’s most well known work.
Rather what is provided here is a number of informational comments on Gilbert
Simondons career as well as his other, more recent, and lesser-known publications.
The best presentation o f M ode o f E xistence is, of course, the Prospectus created by
the author for the first edition published in 1958 in Paris and which appears in its
entirety after this note. The reader will also find, at the end o f this present note, a
“summary” of the book that was written later by the author himself.
Gilbert Simondon (1924-1989) was a student at the École Normale Supérieure
(rue d’Ulm in Paris) from 1944-1948. Attaining the status of agrégé de philosoph ie ,
he began his career teaching philosophy at the lycée de Tours (teaching philosophy
to high school students as is still a common practice in the French educational
system) and later on taught at the University o f Poitiers. He defended his doctoral
thesis [thèse de doctorat] in 1958 and was then named professor at the Sorbonne
in 1963. Only his two principal works are published while he is a living philoso­
pher, On The M ode o f E xistence o f Technical O bjects and L T n dividuation à la lum ière
des notions de fo rm e et d 'in form ation [In d iv id u atio n in ligh t o f notions o f fo rm a n d
in form ation ].

Since then, his other writings, lectures, and conference papers, written between
1950 and 1985, have been assembled into a dozen more published works. D eux
leçons su r T an im al et l'hom m e, L'inven tion d an s les techniques, C ours su r la perception ,
Im agin ation et inven tion , C om m unication et in fo rm atio n , S u r la technique, S u r la
psychologie , S u r la philosoph ie , and finally la R ésolution des problèm es.
The career o f Gilbert Simondon was that o f a typical academie and researcher. It
became the perpetual deployment o f the ideas and concepts contained in the first
two published works, as much within the lectures and notes of his yearly courses he

taught at the university, as in the research he actively undertook in the laboratory
he directed at the Sorbonne (and later on when the Sorbonne was divided into
other branches, at the Université Paris V). Through the study of invention, percep­
tion, and imagination, this research develops the preoccupations that led him, as a
philosopher and scientist, to grasp the problem of information in its relation with
individuation, at the beginning of the 1950 s.
How does something appear, how is something capable of becoming individu­
ated, how does a given structure, a given form emerge? How, on the other hand,
can it be grasped by thought? This problem, that is in no way new but by way of
Simondon’s approach to it is renewed through a critique of the concept of hylomorphism (matter and form) that masks the principal point o f individuation, is at
the heart of everything: of physics, of technics, of the problems that technics poses
to human beings, of the living, and in the end the individuation of man himself,
in as much for thinking the psycho-physiological relation (and to grasp in another
way the problem of relation of the soul and the body) as for thinking the social and
the collective and, as a result, rethinking the human sciences. As the author himself
notes in preparatory notes, this is an ontological and epistemological problem,
which also involves a value judgment, that is an “axiontological” problem. It is a
“reflexive” problem, i.e., a philosophical problem. Gilbert Simondons intention
is to make people understand that a true individual is not simply something that
is individuated, enclosed within his separate being, but is rather a theatre for new
individuations. The collective, if it is not conflated with the purely social, is the site
of this liberation and of a veritable progress. As such, “ethics is the direction [sens]
of individuation” and “societies become a world.” 1
These works were conducted throughout the 1950s with a full awareness of
the other philosophies in the midst of development, and with a full awareness
of the need for philosophy to be connected to life in all its varied dimensions
(what Gilbert Simondon calls “the incompletion of non-reflexive life” {l'inachève­
m ent de la vie non-réflexive]). But no philosophical school seemed to provide the
means for what is required to achieve this: “A reflexive attitude must begin by
avoiding to postulate a specific determined end or affiliation [appartenance] at the
very moment when it begins to exist and strives to define itself. A philosophy
that would accept being defined by way of some qualifier such as “Christian”,
“Marxist”, or “Phenomenological” would find the negation of its philosophical
nature within this initial determination” (“Note sur l’attitude reflexive”, in Su r la
philosophie ). Existentialism is itself reckless and lacking in prudence: “It is perfectly1

xi
true that a vital engagement is an inexhaustible source of rigor [de sérieux ], but it
is uncertain whether this quality of authenticity can be directly transposed into
an explicit thought according to an intellectual systematic that is already classified
and known. The explicit translation of an engaged implicit thought runs the risk
of being abstract in spite of the force of the concrete position it wants to express:
nothing can guarantee the authenticity of the transposition.” If philosophy must
bear the weight of the concern for the concrete, if s by way of a long detour of the
most radical analysis of things, by way of the study of ontogenesis and the condi­
tions o f an individuation (placing into relation form, information, and potential).
This analysis alone has the power of unmasking the psychosocial myths that serve
as political theories.
And the same can be said for technics as well, the study must be a genetic one,
and allow itself to leave behind the false categories (of genera and species) to which
we reduce technical objects when we think of them starting from the way they
are used. Individuation must be studied within the technical domain, alongside
physical individuation as well as psychical and biological [vital] individuation: for
the very reason that the technical object “is that from which there is a genesis”.
Technics is even a domain in which individuation plays itself out in a remarkable
fashion, in the case of technical invention where a mental operation and a tech­
nical operation coincide. Part III of this present book (The Genesis of Technicity)
locates technics within a more global perspective of a genetic theory of culture. The
dimension that Gilbert Simondon grants to the study of technics, in making it the
unique object of his complementary thesis is already justified in the introduction
of On The M ode O f Existence o f Technical O bjects by way of a principal issue, linked
to the problem technics poses to culture: the technical object, that impoverished
relative of culture, is not granted the same dignity that is, in contrast, conferred
to the aesthetic object. As we see emphasized in the “Note complémentaire sur les
conséquences de la notion d’individuation” (from ILFI), technics is a fundamental
issue that is in no way whatsoever foreign to the general preoccupations concerning
psychic and collective individuation. For the very reason that technics is the way
in which man is in relation with the world, and not simply with a community that
is closed in on itself. Hence the importance of invention, that loosens or frees the
community through opening it up to a true and free society, and the importance of
the welcoming of technics into and by culture: technics is not, for the philosopher,
simply an object among others, technics constitutes a field of reflection that phi­
losophy must plunge into and become invested [investir ]. A lucid gaze focused on
technical objects must first and foremost delineate their diverse modes of existence

xii
(element, individual, ensemble) if one wants culture, in its relation to technics,
to be the bearer of freedom [liberté ] and not alienation. Certain prolonged anal­
yses that began in On The M ode o f Existence o f Technical O bjects, developed in
chapters that were not integrated into the original version of the thesis, have now
become available in the published volume S u r la philosophie (Paris: PUF, 2016): see
for instance “The technical object as paradigm of universal intelligibility,”2 “The
order of technical objects as axiological universal paradigm in interhuman relation
(Introduction to a transductive philosophy).”3
The later works of Gilbert Simondon concerning technics continue the con­
struction site opened up by the early work that takes place in O n The M ode o f
Existence o f Technical O bjects: there are numerous texts concerning the social and
cultural modes of existence of technical objects (for example Psychosociologie de la
technicité) as well as the problem of an adequate relation between man and techni­
cal objects. Other texts are more concerned with the conditions of true progress,
and still others are more focused on invention, in its objective aspect (and the
conditions favoring its emergence) and in its mental aspect. More generally, the
works on perception, imagination, and communication are driven by the same
perspective that Gilbert Simondon held onto from the very first of his writings:
to understand these processes by way of grasping what individuates, to construct a
reflexive path (even, and above all within the area o f psychology) that never gives
up on “optative” (the hoped for), i.e., that by which every problem that is posed to
man can be thought and reflected upon according to its true dimensions, and, as
such, should then be resolved.

Summary o f On The M ode O f Existence o f Technical Objects
by Gilbert Simondon

This present work is concerned with the essence of technical objects and their
relation to man. While the aesthetic object has been considered suitable material
for philosophical reflection, the technical object, treated as an instrument, has only

“L’ordre des objets techniques comme paradigme d’universalité axiologique dans la relation interhumaine (Introduc­
tion à une philosophie transductive)”.

xiii
ever been directly studied across the multiple modalities of its relation to man as an
economic reality, as an instrument of work, or, indeed, of consumption.
The nonessential character of knowledge of the technical object with respect to
its different relations to man has contributed to masking a task incumbent upon
philosophical thought: to rediscover, through a deepening of the relation which
exists between nature, man, and technical reality, the burden of alienated human
reality which is enclosed within the technical object. The technical object, taking
the place of the slave and being treated as such across relations of property and
custom, has only partially liberated man: the technical object possesses a power
of alienation because it is itself in a state of alienation, one more essential than
economic or social alienation.
The importance o f technical objects in contemporary cultures requires philosophical
thought to make the effort o f reducing technological alienation by introducing into cul­
ture a representation and scale o f values adequate to the essence o f technical objects.
The discovery o f this essence must be carried out through a study o f the genesis o f tech­
nical objects, achieving itself [s'accomplissant] through a process o f concretization which is
different from successive empirical corrections and from deduction from prior theoretical
principles: there is a specific genesis o f the technical object.
A historical study allows for the discovery o f the regulative function o f culture in the
relation between man and the technical object, especially across the normative foundation
o f the successive manifestations o f encyclopedic spirit, from the technicism o f the Sophists
up to cybernetic theory, passing through the open and the autonomous awareness o f the
work o f Diderot and d’Alembert.
Finally, a study o f the contemporary modalities o f the relation between man and the
technical object shows that the notion o f information is the most suitable for accomplish­
ing the integration o f culture with a representative and axiological content adequate to
technical reality envisaged in its essence, man becoming, after, invention, the active center
and actor who alone can bring into existence a coherent technological world.

PROSPECTUS
Presentation written in 1958 by Gilbert Simondon

The book titled On the M ode o f Existence o f Technical O bjects aims at introducing
a knowledge into culture that is adequate to technical objects considered on three
levels: elements, individuals, ensembles. A gap manifests itself in our civilization
between the attitudes provoked in man by the technical object and the true nature
of these objects; from this inadequate and confused rapport a set of mythologi­
cal valuations and devaluations arises in the consumer, the manufacturer, and the
worker; in order to replace this inadequate rapport with a veritable relation, one
has to become aware of the mode of existence of technical objects.
This becoming aware takes place in three stages.
The first seeks to grasp the genesis o f technical objects: the technical object
mustn’t be seen as an artificial being; the sense of its evolution is a concretization; a primitive technical object is an abstract system of isolated partial ways of
functioning, without common ground o f existence, without reciprocal causality,
without internal resonance; a perfected technical object is an individualized tech­
nical object in which each structure is pluri-functional, overdetermined; in it each
structure exists not only as organ, but as body, as milieu, and as ground for other
structures; in this system of compatibility whose systematicity [systém atique] takes
form just as an axiomatic saturates, each element fulfills not only a function in the
whole [ensem ble] but a function of the whole. There is something like a redundancy
of information in the technical object having become concrete.
This notion of information allows the general evolution of technical objects
to be interpreted via the succession of elements, of individuals and of ensembles,
according to the law of conservation of technicity. The veritable progress of tech­
nical objects takes place through a schema of relaxation and not of continuity:
there is a preservation throughout the successive cycles of evolution of technicity
as information.

xvi
The second phase envisions the rapport between man and the technical object,
on the one hand at the level of the individual, and on the other hand, at the level
of ensembles. The individual's mode of access to the technical object is m inor or
m ajor; the minor mode is the mode appropriate for the knowledge o f the tool or the
instrument; it is primitive, but adequate to this level of the existence of technicity
in the form of tools or instruments; it turns man into a bearer of tools, according
to a concrete apprenticeship, a sort o f instinctive symbiosis of man and the techni­
cal object employed in a determinate milieu, according to intuition and implicit,
almost innate knowledge. The major mode presupposes the becoming aware of
the ways of functioning: it is polytechnic. Diderot and Alemberts Encyclopedia
illustrates the passage from the minor to the major mode.
A t the level o f ensem bles, the awareness that the group gains from its rapport with
technical objects is translated by way of diverse modes o f the notion o f progress,
which are the various value judgments made by the group regarding the power
harbored by technical objects in order to facilitate the evolution o f the group:
the optimistic progress of the 18th century corresponds to the awareness of the
improvement of elements; the pessimistic and dramatic progress o f the 19th cen­
tury corresponds to the replacement o f the individual human tool bearer by the
machine individual, as well as corresponding to the anxiety resulting from the
frustration of this progress. Finally, what remains to be elaborated is a new notion
of progress corresponding to the discovery o f technics at the level of the ensembles
of our epoch, by virtue of a deepening of the theory o f information and communi­
cation: the true nature of man is not to be a tool bearer — and thus a competitor
of the machine, but man's nature is that o f the inventor of technical and living
objects capable of resolving problems of compatibility between machines within
an ensemble; he coordinates and organizes their mutual relation at the level o f
machines, between machines; more than simply governing them, he renders them
compatible, he is the agent and translator of information from machine to machine,
intervening within the margin o f indeterminacy harbored by the open machine's
way of functioning, which is capable of receiving information. Man constructs the
signification of the exchanges o f information between machines. The inadequate
rapport of man and the technical object must therefore be grasped as a coupling
between the living and the non-living. Pure automatism, excluding man and aping
the living, is a myth that does not correspond to the highest level of possible technicity: there is no machine of all machines.
Finally, the third phase of becoming aware, places the technical object back
into the ensem ble o f the real, seeking to know the technical object according to its

xvii
essence, according to a genesis of technicity. The basic hypothesis of the employed
philosophical doctrine consists in supposing the existence of a primitive mode of
man's relation with the world, which is the magical mode: from an internal rupture
of this relation arise two simultaneous and opposite phases, the technical phase
and the religious phase; technicity is the mobilization of the figurai functions,
the extraction of the key-points of man’s relation with the world; religiosity on
the contrary refers to the respect for the ground functions: it is the attachment to
the totality in its ground. This relation o f ph ase shifts o f m an to the w orld obtain s an
im perfect m ediation v ia aesthetic activity : aesthetic thought preserves the nostalgia
of man’s primitive relation to the world; it is a neutrality between opposing phases;
but its concrete character as constructor of objects limits its power of mediation,
for the aesthetic object loses its neutrality, and consequently its power of mediation
by seeking to become either functional or sacred. It is only at the level of both the
most primitive and the most elaborate of all thoughts, philosophical thought, that
a truly n eu tral and balan ced because complete, mediation between opposing phases
can intervene. It is thus p h ilosoph ical thought alone that can assume the knowl­
edge, valorization and completion of the phase of technicity within the entirety
[ensemble] of man’s modes of being in the world, by way of a meditation regarding
the rapport between science and technics, theology and mysticism.

Introduction

This study is motivated by our desire to raise awareness of the meaning of technical
objects. Culture has constituted itself as a defense system against technics1; yet this
defense presents itself as a defense of man, and presumes that technical objects
do not contain a human reality within them. We would like to show that culture
ignores a human reality within technical reality and that, in order to fully play
its role, culture must incorporate technical beings in the form o f knowledge and
in the form of a sense of values. Awareness of the modes of existence of technical
objects must be brought about through philosophical thought, which must fulfill a
duty through this work analogous to the one it fulfilled for the abolition o f slavery
and the affirmation of the value of the human person.
The opposition drawn between culture and technics, between man and machine,
is false and has no foundation; it is merely a sign of ignorance or resentment.
Behind a facile humanism, it masks a reality rich in human efforts and natural
forces, and which constitutes a world of technical objects as mediators between
man and nature.1
1. The broad key term, “la technique,” and its plural, “les techniques,” are translated uniformly throughout by the more
specialized “technics,” meaning the theory or study o f industry and of the mechanical arts; while this term, as a collective
plural used in the singular along the same lines as “physics,” is usually a near synonym to “technology” and is differentiated
in English from “technique” insofar as the latter refers to the almost ineffably practical and particular application o f technics
to a given concrete task, in French the singular “la technique” and the plural “les techniques” cover together the meanings
covered both by “technique” or “techniques” in English and by “technics,” and so the word “technics” as it appears in this
text accordingly covers both. Moreover, Simondon is careful to distinguish “technics” from “technology,” which remains
programmatic in Simondons text and the elaboration o f which, as a philosophical logos or meta-theory o f technics, this text
may be construed as an outline. [TN]

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Culture behaves toward the technical object as man toward a stranger, when he
allows himself to be carried away by primitive xenophobia. Misoneism directed
against machines is not so much a hatred of novelty as it is a rejection of a strange
or foreign reality. However, this strange or foreign being is still human, and a com­
plete culture is one which enables us to discover the foreign or strange as human.
Furthermore, the machine is the stranger; it is the stranger inside which something
human is locked up, misunderstood, materialized, enslaved, and yet which never­
theless remains human all the same. The most powerful cause of alienation in the
contemporary world resides in this misunderstanding of the machine, which is not
an alienation caused by the machine, but by the non-knowledge of its nature and
its essence, by way of its absence from the world of significations, and its omission
from the table of values and concepts that make up culture.
Culture is unbalanced because it recognizes certain objects, like the aesthetic
object, granting them citizenship in the world of significations, while it banishes
other objects (in particular technical objects) into a structureless world o f things
that have no signification but only a use, a utility function. Confronted by such
a defensive rejection, pronounced by a partial and biased culture, men who have
knowledge of technical objects and who appreciate their signification seek to jus­
tify their judgment by granting the technical object the only status currently valued
besides that of the aesthetic object, namely that of the sacred object. This, then,
gives rise to an intemperate technicism which is nothing other than idolatry o f the
machine and which, through this idolatry, by means of identification, leads to a
technocratic aspiration to unconditional power. The desire for power consecrates
the machine as a means of supremacy, it makes of it a modern philter. The man
who wants to dominate his peers calls the android machine into being. He thus
abdicates before it and delegates his humanity to it. He seeks to construct a think­
ing machine, dreams of being able to build a volition machine, a living machine,
in order to retreat behind it without anxiety, freed of all danger, exempt from all
feelings of weakness, and triumphant through the mediation of what he invented.
In this case, however, the machine, after having become, according to the imagi­
nation, the robot, this duplicate of man devoid of interiority, quite evidently and
inevitably represents a purely mythical and imaginary being.
We would like to show, precisely, that the robot does not exist, that it is not a
machine, no more so than a statue is a living being, but that it is merely a product
of the imagination and of fictitious fabrication, of the art of illusion. The notion
of the machine as it currently exists in culture, however, incorporates to a great
extent this mythical representation of the robot. An educated man would never

INTRODUCTION

dare to speak of objects or figures painted on a canvas as genuine realities, having
inferiority, good or ill will. However, this same man speaks of machines as threat­
ening man, as if he attributed a soul and a separate, autonomous existence to them,
conferring on them the use of sentiment and intention toward man.
Culture thus has two contradictory attitu d es toward technical objects: on the one
hand, it treats them as pure assem blages o f m atter, devoid of true signification, and
merely presenting a utility. On the other hand, it supposes that these objects are
also robots and that they are animated by hostile intentions toward man, or that
they represent a permanent danger o f aggression and insurrection against him. And
judging it better to cling to the first characteristic, it seeks to prevent the manifes­
tation of the second and speaks of placing machines in the service of man, in the
belief that the reduction to slavery is a sure way to prevent any rebellion.
This inherent contradiction within culture in fact comes from the ambiguity
of the ideas related to automatism, and in them we discover the hidden logical
flaw. Worshipers o f the machine commonly present the degree of perfection of a
machine as proportional to the degree of automatism. Going beyond what experi­
ence shows, they suppose that by increasing and perfecting automatism one would
manage to combine and interconnect all machines among themselves, in such a
way as to constitute the machine o f all machines.
Automatism, however, is a rather low degree o f technical perfection. In order to
make a machine automatic, one must sacrifice a number of possibilities of oper­
ation as well as numerous possible usages. Automatism, and its utilization in the
form of industrial organization, which one calls autom ation , possesses an economic
or social signification more than a technical one. The true progressive perfecting
of machines, whereby we could say a machines degree of technicity is raised, cor­
responds not to an increase of automatism, but on the contrary to the fact that
the operation of a machine harbors a certain margin of indeterminacy. It is this
margin that allows the machine to be sensitive to outside information. Much more
than any increase in automatism, it is this sensitivity to information on the part of
machines that makes a technical ensemble possible. A purely automatic machine
completely closed in on itself in a predetermined way of operating would only be
capable of yielding perfunctory results. The machine endowed with a high degree
of technicity is an open machine, and all open machines taken together [l ’ensem ble
des m achines ouvertes] presuppose man as their permanent organizer, as the living
interpreter of all machines among themselves. Far from being the supervisor of a
group of slaves, man is the permanent organizer of a society of technical objects
that need him in the same way musicians in an orchestra need the conductor. The

18

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

conductor can only direct the musicians because he plays the piece the same way
they do, as intensely as they all do; he tempers or hurries them, but is also tempered
or hurried by them; in fact, it is through the conductor that the members of the
orchestra temper or hurry one another, he is the moving and current form of the
group as it exists for each of them; he is the mutual interpreter of all of them in
relation to one another. Man thus has the function o f being the permanent coordi­
nator and inventor of the machines that surround him. He is am ong the machines
that operate with him.
Man’s presence to machines is a perpetuated invention. What resides in the
machines is human reality, human gesture fixed and crystallized into working
structures. These structures need support during the course of their operation, and
the greatest perfection coincides with the greatest openness, with the greatest free­
dom of operation. Modern calculating machines are not pure automata; they are
technical beings that, beyond their automatisms of addition (or o f decision accord­
ing to the operation o f elementary switches), possess a great range o f possibilities
for the switching circuits, which allow for the coding of the machines operation
by reducing its margin of indeterminacy. This primitive margin of indeterminacy
is what allows the same machine to extract cube roots or to translate a simple
text, composed of a small number of words and expressions, from one language
into another.
It is also through the intermediary o f this margin o f indeterminacy and not
through automatisms that machines can be grouped into coherent ensembles and
exchange information with one another via the intermediary of the coordinator
that is the human interpreter. Even when two machines exchange information
directly (as between a master oscillator and another pulse synchronized oscillator),
man intervenes as a being who regulates the margin of indeterminacy in order to
a d a p t it to th e b e st p o ssib le e x c h a n g e o f in fo r m a tio n .

Now, one might wonder who can achieve within himself an awareness of tech­
nical reality and introduce it to culture. This awareness can hardly be achieved
by someone who is attached to a single machine through work and the fixity
of daily gestures; the use relation is not conducive to the raising of awareness,
because its habitual repetition erases the awareness of structures and operations
with the stereotypy of adapted gestures. Running a company that uses machines,
or owning one, is no more useful for the attainment of this awareness than is labor:
it creates abstract points of view regarding the machine, causing it to be judged,
not in its own right, but according to its costs and the results of its operation.
Scientific knowledge, which sees in the technical object the practical application of

INTRODUCTION
a theoretical law, is not at the proper level of the technical domain either. Rather, it
would appear that this task of understanding is left to the engineer of organization
who would be like a sociologist or psychologist of machines, living in the midst of
this society of technical beings as its responsible and inventive consciousness.
A genuine awareness of technical realities, grasped in their signification, corre­
sponds to an open plurality of techniques. It cannot, moreover, be otherwise because
a technical ensemble, even one that is not very extensive, comprises machines whose
principles of operation are derived from very different scientific domains. So-called
“technical” specialization most often corresponds to matters that are, strictly
speaking, external to the technical objects (public relations, a particular form of
commerce), rather than corresponding to a kind of operational schema within the
technical objects; it is this specialization according to directives that are external
to technics that creates the narrow-mindedness attributed to technicians by the
cultivated man who intends to distinguish himself from them: it is a question of
a narrow-mindedness of intentions, of ends, rather than a narrow-mindedness of
information or of technical intuition. Today, it is rare for machines not to be, to
some extent, simultaneously mechanical, thermal, and electric.
In order to restore to culture the truly general character it has lost, one must be
capable of reintroducing an awareness of the nature of machines, of their mutual
relations and of their relations with man, and of the values implied in these rela­
tions. This awareness requires the existence of a technologist or mechanologisU
alongside the psychologist and the sociologist. Moreover, these fundamental sche­
mas of causality and regulation that constitute an axiomatic o f technology, must be
taught in a universal fashion, in the same way the foundations of literary culture
are taught. The initiation to technics must be placed on the same level as scientific
education; it is as disinterested as the practice of the arts, and it dominates practical
applications as much as theoretical physics does; it can attain the same degree of
abstraction and symbolization. A child ought to know what self-regulation is, or
what a positive reaction is, in the same way a child knows mathematical theorems.
This cultural reform, proceeding through expansion and not through destruc­
tion, could return the true regulative power that it has lost to todays culture. As
the basis of significations, of means of expression, of justifications and of forms, a
culture establishes regulatory communication among those who share that culture;
arising from the life of the group, culture animates the gestures o f those who ensure
the command functions, by providing norms and schemas. However, before the
great development of technics, culture incorporated the principal types of tech­
nics that give rise to lived experience, in the form of schemas, symbols, qualities,

20

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

and analogies. Our current culture, by contrast, is the old culture, incorporating
16 as its dynamic schemas the state of artisanal and agricultural technics of bygone
centuries. And it is these schemas that serve as mediators between groups and
their leaders, imposing a fundamental distortion, as a result of their inadequacy to
technics. Power becomes literature, the art o f opinion, advocacy of plausibility, and
rhetoric. The directive functions are false, because an adequate code of relations
between the governed reality and the beings who govern no longer exists: the gov­
erned reality comprises men and machines; the code merely relies on the experience
of the man working with tools, an experience which itself has become weakened
and remote because those who use this code haven’t, like Cincinnatus, let go of
the handles of the plow only yesterday. The symbol is weakened into a mere lin­
guistic turn of phrase, reality is absent. A regulative relation of circular causality
cannot be established between the whole of governed reality and the function of
authority: information no longer achieves its purpose because the code has become
inadequate to the type of information it is supposed to transmit. Information
that will express the simultaneous and correlative existence of men and machines
must comprise the machines’ schemas of functioning and the values they imply.
Culture, which has become specialized and impoverished, must once again become
general. By removing one of its principal sources of alienation and by re-establish­
ing regulative information, this extension of culture possesses political and social
value: it can give man the means for thinking his existence and situation according
to the reality that surrounds him. This work of broadening and deepening culture
also has a properly philosophical role to play because it leads to the critique of a
certain number of myths and stereotypes, such as that of the robot, or of perfect
automata at the service of a lazy and fulfilled humanity.
In order to raise this awareness, it is possible to attempt to define the technical
17 object itself, through the process of concretization and functional over-determi­
nation that gives it its consistency at the end-point of a process of evolution, thus
proving that it cannot be considered as a mere utensil.
The modalities of this genesis enable one to grasp the three levels of the technical
object and their non-dialectical temporal coordination: the element, the individ­
ual, and the ensemble.
Once the technical object is defined through its genesis, it becomes possible to
study the relations between the technical object and other realities, in particular
that of man at the stage of adulthood or childhood.
Lastly, considered as an object of value judgment, the technical object can pro­
voke very different attitudes depending on whether it is considered at the level

INTRODUCTION

21

of the element, at the level of the individual, or at the level of the ensemble.
At the level of the element, the process of its improvement does not introduce any
upheavals that would engender anxiety by conflicting with acquired habits: this is
the climate of eighteenth century optimism, which introduces the idea of contin­
uous and indefinite progress, bringing about the constant improvement o f mans
lot. The technical individual entity, on the contrary, becomes for a certain time
the adversary of man, his competitor, because man had centralized technical indi­
viduality within himself at a time when only tools existed; the machine thus takes
the place of man because, as tool bearer, man used to do the job the machine now
does. To this phase corresponds a dramatic and impassioned notion of progress,
which turns into the rape of nature, the conquest o f the world, and the exploitation
of energies. This will to power expresses itself in the technophile and technocratic
excesses of the thermodynamic era, which take on both a prophetic and cataclys­
mic spin. Finally, at the level of the technical ensembles of the twentieth century,
this thermodynamic energeticism is replaced by information theory, whose content
is normative and eminently regulative and stabilizing: the development of technics
appears to be a guarantee of stability. The machine, as an element o f the techni­
cal ensemble, becomes that which increases the quantity of information, increases
negentropy, and opposes the degradation of energy: the machine, being a work of
organization and information, is, like life itself and together with life, that which
is opposed to disorder, to the leveling of all things tending to deprive the universe
of the power of change. The machine is that through which man fights against the
death of the universe; it slows down the degradation of energy, as life does, and
becomes a stabilizer of the world.
This modification of the philosophical way of looking at the technical object
announces the possibility of introducing the technical being into culture: this inte­
gration, which could not have taken place in a definitive way at the level of elements
or at the level of individuals, will have a greater chance of stability at the level of
ensembles; once technical reality has become regulative it can be integrated into
culture, which is regulative in its essence. This integration could only have occurred
by way of addition in the age when technicity resided in its elements, or by way
of a breach and a revolution in the age when technicity resided in new technical
individuals; today, technicity tends to reside in ensembles. For this reason, it can
become a foundation for culture, to which it will bring a unifying and stabilizing
power, making culture adequate to the reality which it expresses and regulates.

/. - The abstract technical object
a n d the concrete technical object

Although the technical object is subject to genesis, it is difficult to define the gene­
sis of each technical object, since the individuality of technical objects is modified
throughout the course o f this genesis; technical objects are not easily defined by
attribution to a technical kind; it is easy to summarily distinguish kinds according
to practical usage, as long as one accepts grasping the technical object according to
its practical end; however, this is an illusory specificity, because no fixed structure
corresponds to a definite usage. The same result may be obtained from very differ­
ent functionalities and structures: a steam engine, a gasoline engine, a turbine, and
an engine powered by springs or weights are all equally engines, but there is a more
genuine analogy between a spring engine and a bow or a cross-bow than between
the spring engine and a steam engine; the engine of a pendulum clock is analogous
to a winch, while an electric clock is analogous to a door bell or a buzzer. Usage
unites these heterogeneous structures and operations under the banner of genera
and species that draw their signification from the relation between this functioning
and another functioning, which is that of the human being involved in the action.
That to which one thereby gives a single name — for instance the engine — can
thus be multiple in one instance and may vary in time by changing its individuality.
However, instead of starting out with the individuality of the technical object,
or even with its specificity, which is very unstable, it is preferable to reverse the

21

22

26

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

problem, if we want to try to define the laws of its genesis in light of its individu­
ality or specificity: one can define the individuality and specificity of the technical
object on the basis of the criteria of its genesis: the individual technical object is not
this or that thing, given hic et nunc , but that of which there is genesis.1 The unity
o f the technical object, its individuality, and its specificity are the characteristics
o f consistency and convergence in its genesis. The genesis of the technical object
partakes in its being. The technical object is that which is not anterior to its coming-into-being, but is present at each stage of its coming-into-being; the technical
object in its oneness is a unit of coming-into-being. The gasoline engine is not this
or that engine given in time and space, but the fact that there is a succession, a con­
tinuity that runs through the first engines to those we currently know and which
are still evolving. As such, as in a phylogenetic lineage, a definite stage of evolution
contains dynamic structures and schemas within itself that partake in the principal
stages o f an evolution of forms. The technical being evolves through convergence
and self-adaptation; it unifies itself internally according to a principle of inner res­
onance. Todays automobile engine is the descendent of the engine from 1910 not
simply because the engine of 1910 was built by our ancestors. Nor is today s auto­
mobile engine its descendant simply because it has a greater degree of perfection in
relation to use; in fact, for some uses the engine from 1910 remains superior to an
engine from 1956. For instance, it can tolerate extensive heating without galling
or rod bearing failure, having been built with more flexibility and without fragile
alloys such as Babbitt metal; it is more autonomous, due to its having a magnetic
ignition. Old engines function reliably on fishing boats after having been taken
from a disused automobile. It is through internal examination of the regimes of
causality and forms, insofar as they are adapted to these regimes of causality, that
the contemporary automobile engine is defined as posterior to the engine from
1910. In a contemporary engine each important item is so well connected to the
others via reciprocal exchanges of energy that it cannot be anything other than
what it is. The shape of the combustion chamber, the shape and size of the valves,1
1. According to determinate modalities that distinguish the genesis o f the technical object from that of other types of ob­
jects: the aesthetic object, the living being. These specific modalities o f genesis must be distinguished from a static specificity
that one could establish after genesis by considering the characteristics o f diverse types o f objects; the point of using a genetic
method is precisely to avoid using classification as a way o f thinking that occurs after genesis only to distribute the totality
o f objects into genera and species suitable for discourse. The technical being retains the essence of its past evolution in the
form o f its technicity. According to the approach we shall call analectic, the technical being, as bearer o f this technicity, can
be the object of adequate knowledge only if the latter grasps the temporal sense o f its evolution; this adequate knowledge is
a culture o f technics, distinct from technical knowledge, which is limited to the actuality of isolated schemas of operation.
Considering that the relations that exist between one technical object and another at the level of technicity are horizontal as
well as vertical, any form o f knowledge that procédés by genera and species becomes inadequate: we will attempt to point
out the way in which the relation between technical objects is transductive.

and the shape of the piston all belong to the same system within which a multi­
tude of reciprocal causalities exist. To such a shape of these elements corresponds
a certain compression ratio, which in turn requires a determinate ignition timing;
the shape of the cylinder head, as well as the metal it is made of, produce a certain
temperature in the spark plug electrodes in relation to all the other elements of the
cycle; this temperature in turn causes a reaction leading to the characteristics of
ignition and hence to the entire cycle. One could say that the contemporary engine
is a concrete engine, whereas the old engine is an abstract engine. In the old engine
each element intervenes at a certain moment in the cycle, and then is expected no
longer to act upon the other elements; the pieces of the engine are like people who
work together, each in their own turn, but who do not know one another.
Moreover, this is precisely how the functioning of thermal engines is explained
to students in the classroom, each piece being isolated from the others like the
lines that represent it on the blackboard in geometric space, partes extra partes.
The old engine is a logical assemblage of elements defined by their complete and
unique function. Each element can accomplish its own function best if it is, like
a perfectly completed instrument, oriented entirely to accomplishing this func­
tion. A permanent exchange of energy between two elements appears as if it were
an imperfection, unless this exchange itself belongs to the theoretical operation;
furthermore there is a primitive form of the technical object, the abstract fo rm , in
which each theoretical and material unit is treated as an absolute, and is completed
according to an intrinsic perfection that requires, in order for it to function, that
it be constituted as a closed system; integration into an ensemble in this case raises
a series of so-called technical problems that must be resolved and which are in fact
problems of compatibility between already given ensembles.
These already given ensembles need to be maintained and preserved despite their
reciprocal influences. What appears then are particular structures that one can call,
for each constitutive unit, defense structures: the cylinder head of the thermal
combustion engine bristles with cooling fins that are particularly well developed
in the region of the valves, which is subject to intense thermal exchanges and high
pressure. In the first engines these cooling fins are as if added from the outside to
the theoretical cylinder and cylinder head, which are geometrically cylindrical; they
serve only one function, that of cooling. In more recent engines, these cooling fins
also play a mechanical role, as ribs that resist the deformation of the cylinder head
under the pressure of the gasses; in these conditions one can no longer distinguish
the volumetric unit (cylinder, cylinder head) from the thermal dissipation unit;
if, in an engine that uses ambient air for cooling, one were to remove the cylinder

24

25

28

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

heads fins by sawing or grinding, then the volumetric unit constituted by the
cylinder head alone would no longer be viable, even as a volumetric unit: it would
be deformed under the gaseous pressure; the volumetric and mechanical unit has
become coextensive with the unit o f thermal dissipation because the structure of
the ensemble is bivalent: the fins constitute a cooling surface of thermal exchanges
with the stream o f external air; these same fins, insofar as they are a part of the
cylinder head, limit the size o f the combustion chamber through their un-deformable contour, using less metal than would be required by a shell without ribs; the
development of this unique structure is not a compromise, but a concomitance
and a convergence: a ribbed cylinder head can afford to be thinner than a smooth
cylinder head with the same rigidity; a thin cylinder head, in turn, allows for more
efficient thermal exchanges than a thick cylinder head would allow; the bivalent
fin-rib structure improves the cooling not only by increasing the thermal exchange
area (which is what characterizes the fin as a fin), but also by permitting a thinning
of the cylinder head (which is what characterizes the fin as ribbing).
The technical problem is thus one of the convergence of functions into a
structural unit, rather than one of seeking a compromise between conflicting
requirements. If, in the case just considered, a conflict subsists between two aspects
of a single structure, then this is only because the position of the ribbing that
would correspond to maximum rigidity is not necessarily the same as that which
corresponds best to their fastest cooling by way of air flowing between the fins
when the vehicle is running. In this case the builder might have to retain a mixed,
incomplete aspect: the fin-ribbing, if positioned for optimal cooling, will have to
be thicker and more rigid than if it were for ribbing alone. If, on the contrary, they
are positioned perfectly to resolve the problem of obtaining rigidity, then their area
is larger, in order to compensate the reduction of the thermal exchange that had
been diminished because of the slowed airstream, via the development of a larger
area; the very structure of the fins may in the end also be a compromise between
two forms, requiring a greater development than if a single function were taken as
the sole purpose of the structure. This divergence of functional directions is like a
residue of abstraction within the technical object and it is the progressive reduc­
tion of this margin between the functions of plurivalent structures that defines
the progress of a technical object; it is this convergence that specifies the technical
object, because in any given epoch there is no infinite plurality of possible func­
tional systems; there are far fewer technical species than there are usages to which
technical objects are destined; human necessity is infinitely diversifiable, but the
directions of convergence of technical species are finite in number.

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

29

The technical object thus exists as a specific type obtained at the end of a conver­
gent series. This series goes from the abstract to the concrete mode: it tends toward
a state which would turn the technical being into a system that is entirely coherent
within itself and entirely unified.

II.

27

- Conditions o f technical evolution

What are the reasons for this convergence that manifests itself in the evolution of
technical structures? A certain number of extrinsic causes no doubt exist, in par­
ticular those which tend to produce the standardization of spare parts and organs.
Nevertheless, these extrinsic causes are not more powerful than those that tend
toward the multiplication o f types, appropriated for an infinite variety of needs. If
technical objects do evolve toward a small number of specific types then this is by
virtue of an internal necessity and not as a consequence of economic influences or
practical requirements; it is not the production-line that produces standardization,
but rather intrinsic standardization that allows for the production-line to exist. An
effort to discover the reason for the formation of specific types of technical objects
within the transition from artisanal production to industrial production would
mistake the consequence for its condition; the industrialization of production is
rendered possible by the formation of stable types. Artisanal production corre­
sponds to the primitive stage of the evolution of the technical object, i.e., to the
abstract stage; industry corresponds to the concrete stage. The made-to-measure
aspect one finds in the product of artisanal work is inessential; it is the result of this
other, essential aspect of the abstract technical object: namely, that it is grounded
in an analytical organization that always leaves the path open for new possibilities;
these possibilities are the external manifestation of an internal contingency. In the
confrontation between the coherence of technical work and the coherence of a
system of the needs of utilization, it is the coherence of utilization that prevails,
because the technical object that is made to measure is in fact an object without
intrinsic measure; its norms are derived from the outside: it has not yet realized its
internal coherence; it is not a system of the necessary; it corresponds to an open
system of requirements.
Conversely, during the industrial stage, the object achieves its coherence and it
is the system of needs that is now less coherent than the system of the object; needs
mold themselves onto the industrial technical object, which in turn acquires the
power to shape a civilization. It is utilization that becomes an ensemble chiseled to

28

30

29

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

the measures o f the technical object. When individual fancy calls for a customized
automobile, the manufacturer can do no more than take a serial engine, a serial
chassis, and externally modify some aspects, adding decorative details or externally
adjusted accessories to the automobile, which is really the essential technical object:
what can be made to measure are inessential aspects, because they are contingent.
The type of relation that exists between these inessential aspects and the nature
proper to the technical type is a negative one: the more the car is required to
answer to a large number of user demands, the more its essential characteristics
are encumbered with external servitude; the bodywork burdens itself with acces­
sories, shapes no longer correspond to the structures facilitating the best air flow.
The made-to-measure aspect is not only inessential, it goes against the essence of
the technical being, it is like a dead weight imposed from the outside. The car’s
center of gravity rises, its mass increases.
It is not enough, however, to claim that the evolution of the technical object
occurs via a passage from an analytic order to a synthetic order, conditioning the
passage from artisanal production to industrial production: even if this evolution
is necessary, it is not automatic and one ought to seek the causes of this evolv­
ing movement. These causes essentially reside in the imperfection of the abstract
technical object. Because o f its analytic aspect, this object uses more material and
requires more construction work; it is logically simpler, yet technically more com­
plicated, because it is made up of a convergence of several complete systems. It
is more fragile than the concrete technical object, because the relative isolation
of each system that constitutes a functional sub-system threatens, in case of its
malfunction, the preservation o f the other systems. In an internal combustion
engine the cooling process might thus be accomplished by an entirely autono­
mous sub-system; if this sub-system ceases to work, the engine might deteriorate;
if, on the contrary, the cooling process is the effect resulting from the solidar­
ity of the functioning o f the whole, then the functioning itself implies cooling;
in this sense, an air-cooled engine is more concrete than a water-cooled engine:
thermal infrared radiation and convection are effects that cannot but take place;
they are necessitated by its functioning; cooling by water is semi-concrete: if it
were accomplished entirely by a thermosiphon,* it would be almost as concrete as
cooling by air; but the use of a water pump, receiving energy from the engine via
the transmission belt, increases the element of abstraction of this kind of cooling;
one could say that cooling by water is concrete in terms of a safety system (the
presence of water enables summary cooling for a few minutes when the trans­
mission from engine to pump is deficient, thanks to the absorption of calorific

31

energy through evaporation); in its normal functioning, however, it is an abstract
system; moreover, an element of abstraction still subsists in the possibility of the
cooling circuit lacking water. Ignition via an ignition coil and accumulator battery
is, likewise, more abstract than ignition by magneto,* which is itself more abstract
than ignition by the compression of air followed by fuel injection, such as those
used in diesel engines. One could say that in this sense an engine with a magnetic
fly-wheel and which is air-cooled is more concrete than a typical car engine; each
piece plays several roles here; it is not surprising that the scooter is the brain-child
of an engineer specializing in aviation; while the automobile can afford to preserve
remnants of abstraction (cooling by water, ignition by battery and coil), aviation
is obliged to produce the most concrete technical objects, in order to increase safe
functioning and diminish dead weight.
Thus properly speaking, there is a convergence of economic constraints (a dimin­
ished quantity of raw material, o f work and of energy consumption during use)
and technical requirements: the object cannot be self-destructive, it must maintain
itself in a stable state of functioning for as long as possible. As far as these two
types of cause — the economic and the properly technical — are concerned, it
would appear that it is the latter that predominates in technical evolution; eco­
nomic causes indeed exist in all domains; yet it is mostly within the domains where
technical constraints prevail over economic constraints (aviation, military equip­
ment) that become the most active sites for progress. Indeed, economic causes are
not pure; they interfere with a diffuse network of motivations and preferences that
attenuate or even reverse them (a taste for luxury, the users desire for very apparent
novelty, commercial propaganda), to such an extent that in domains where the
technical object is known through social myths or fads in public opinion, rather
than being appreciated in itself, certain tendencies toward complication come to
light; some car manufacturers thus present the use of overabundant automatism
in accessories or the systematic recourse to servo-mechanisms as an increase in
perfection, even where direct command does not in the least exceed the physical
strength of the driver: some even go so far as to find a sales argument and proof
of superiority in the suppression of direct means, as for instance that of the use
of the crank as a back-up means of starting the engine, which in fact consists
in making its operation more analytic in subordinating it to the use of available
electric energy accumulated in batteries; technically this represents a complication,
whereas the manufacturer presents this suppression as a simplification that would
show how modern the car is, thereby making the unpleasant affective connotations
of the stereotypical image of a car engine that is difficult to start a thing of the past.

32

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

A nuance of ridicule is thus projected onto other cars — those that preserve
the crank — which are somehow out of date, discarded into the past through
an artifice of presentation. The automobile, a technical object charged with psy­
chic and social inferences, is not suitable for technical progress: the automobiles
progress comes from neighboring domains, such as aviation, shipping, and trans­
portation trucks.
The specific evolution of technical objects occurs neither in an absolutely contin­
uous nor completely discontinuous manner; it is made up of stages that are defined
by the fact that they produce successive systems of coherence; between stages mark­
ing a structural re-organization there can be an evolution of a continuous kind; this
is due to the progressive perfection o f details resulting from experience and use, and
from the production of better adapted raw materials or auxiliary devices; for thirty
years the automobile engine improved through the use of metals that were better
adapted to the conditions of utilization, through the increase of the compression
ratio as a result of research into fuels, and through the study of the particular form
of cylinder heads and piston heads in relation to the phenomenon of detonation. *
The problem that consists in producing combustion while avoiding detonation can
be resolved only through work of a scientific kind on the propagation of the explo­
sive wave at the heart of a carburized mix, at different pressure levels, at different
temperatures, with diverse volumes and starting from determinate ignition points.
This effort, however, does not itself lead directly to applications: the experimental
work remains to be accomplished and there is a technicity proper to this path
toward progressive perfection. What is essential in the coming-into-being of this
object are the structural reforms that facilitate the technical objects self-specifica­
tion; even if the sciences were to stop progressing for a time, the progress of the
technical object toward specificity would continue; the principle of this progress
is effectively the manner in which the object causes and conditions itself in its
functioning and in the reactions of its functioning on its utilization; the technical
object, issued forth from the abstract work of the organization of sub-systems, is
the theater of a certain number of reciprocal causal relations.
It is due to these relations, given certain limits of the conditions of utilization,
that the object encounters obstacles within its own operation: the play o f limits,
whose overcoming constitutes progress, resides in the incompatibilities that arise from
the progressive saturation o f the system o f sub-ensembles;1 yet because of its very nature,

this overcoming can occur only as a leap, as a modification of the internal distri­
bution of functions, a rearrangement of their system; what was once an obstacle2

must become the means of realization. Such is the case regarding the evolution of
the electronic tube, whose most common type is the radio lamp. What caused the
structural reforms, whose end point is today’s series of lamps, were the internal
obstacles preventing the proper functioning of the triode. One of the most prob­
lematic phenomena of the triode was the significant reciprocal capacitance within
the system formed by the command grid and anode; this capacitance was in fact
the capacitive coupling between two electrodes, and one could not notably increase
the size of these electrodes without running the risk of initiating self-oscillation;
this inevitable internal coupling had to be compensated for by way of an external
assembly, in particular through neutrodyning, which was achieved by using an
assembly of symmetrical lamps with anode-grid coupling.
In order to resolve the difficulty rather than avoid it, an electrostatic plate was
inserted into the triode, between the command grid and the anode; this addition,
however, adds more than just the advantage o f an electric screen. The screen cannot
exclusively accomplish the function of decoupling for which it was meant: placed
inside the space between grid and anode, it intervenes with its differential potential
(with respect to both grid and anode) as another grid with respect to the anode and
as anode with respect to the grid. It needs to be brought to a potential superior to
that of the grid and inferior to that of the anode; failing this condition, no electron
passes through or else the electrons arrive at the screen rather than the anode. The
screen thus acts upon the electrons in transit between the grid and the anode; it is
itself both a grid and an anode; these two conjugated functions are not obtained
intentionally; they impose themselves by themselves as a surplus that results from
the systemic aspect of the technical object. In order to introduce the screen into
the triode without disturbing its operation it must at once fulfill functions relating
to the electrons in transit, as well as its electrostatic function. Considered as a
simple electrostatic plate, it could be brought to any degree of voltage, provided
this remains a direct current; but it would thereby upset the dynamic functioning
of the triode. It necessarily becomes an accelerating grid for the flow of electrons
and also plays a positive role in the dynamic functioning: it notably increases inter­
nal resistance, and consequently the coefficient of amplification, when brought
to a determinate level of voltage, defined by its exact position in the grid-anode
space. The tetrode is then no longer simply a triode without electrostatic coupling
between anode and command grid; the tetrode is an electronic tube with great
gain, with which one can obtain an amplification of the order of 200 rather than
an amplification of 30 to 30 as far as the triode is concerned.

34

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

However, this discovery also contained an inconvenience: what became prob­
lematic in the tetrode was a phenomenon of the secondary emission o f electrons by
the anode, which tended to bounce all the electrons coming from the cathode (the
primary electrons) and which had already passed through the command grid back
onto the screen in the opposite direction; Tellegen therefore introduced another
screen between the first screen and the anode: once brought to a negative potential
with respect to the anode and screen (generally the potential of the cathode or
even more negative a potential) this wide-meshed grid no longer obstructs the
arrival of accelerated electrons going from the cathode to the anode, but acts as
a negatively polarized command grid and stops the return of secondary electrons
going against the direction of the flow. The pentode is thus the outcome of the
tetrode, in the sense that it contains a supplementary command grid with a fixed
potential that completes the dynamic schema of functioning; the same effect of
irreversibility, however, can be obtained by concentrating the flow of electrons into
beams; if the bars of the accelerating screen-grid are placed in the electric shadow
of the command grid wires, then the phenomenon of secondary emission is greatly
reduced. Furthermore, the capacitance variation between cathode and screen-grid
during functioning becomes very minor (0.2 pF instead of 1.8 pF), practically
preventing all frequency drift when the tube is used in a circuit that generates oscil­
lations. Consequently, one could say that the tetrode's schema of functioning is not
perfectly complete in itself, if one considers the screen merely as an electrostatic
shield, that is, as a barrier that can be brought to any continuous voltage whatso­
ever; this definition, however, is too broad; the definition of the tetrode needs to
include the multifunctionality of the screen into the electronic tube, which hap­
pens by reducing both the margin of indeterminacy of the continuous voltage to
be applied to the screen (in order for it to be an accelerator) and that of its position
in the grid-anode space; a first reduction consists in specifying that the continuous
voltage will have to be an intermediary between the grid and the anodes voltage;
one thus obtains a structure that is stable with respect to the acceleration of pri­
mary electrons, but which still remains indeterminate with respect to the transit
of secondary electrons coming from the anode; this structure in turn is still too
open, too abstract; it can be closed, so that it corresponds to a necessary and stable
functioning, either via a supplementary structure — the suppressive grid or third
grid — or through greater precision in the positioning of the screen-grid with
respect to the other elements, which consists in aligning its wires with those of the
command grid. It is worth noting that the addition of a third grid is equivalent
to an increase in the degree of determinacy in the screen-grids positioning: there

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

35

is a reversibility between the functional aspect of the determination of structures
already existing by their reciprocal causality and the functional aspect of a supple­
mentary structure; closing down the system of the existing structures’ reciprocal
causality with increased determinacy is equivalent to adding a new structure spe­
cialized in accomplishing a determinate function. In the technical object there is a
reversibility between function and structure; over-determination of the system of
structures within the regime of their functioning makes the technical object more
concrete by stabilizing its functioning without adding a new structure. A tetrode
with targeted beams is equivalent to a pentode; it is even superior in its function as
a power amplifier of acoustic frequencies, because of the lower degree of distortion
it produces. The adjunction of a supplementary structure only constitutes genuine
progress for the technical object if this structure incorporates itself concretely into
the totality [ensemble] o f dynamical schemas of functioning; for this reason we will
say that the tetrode with targeted beams is more concrete than the pentode.
One must not confuse the increase o f the concrete aspect of the technical object
with the increase o f the technical objects possibilities via a complication of its
structure; for instance, a twin-grid lamp (which allows separate action on two inde­
pendent control grids in a single cathode-anode space) is no more concrete than a
triode; it is of the same order as the triode, and could, if need be,3 be replaced by
two independent triodes, whose cathodes and anodes would be connected exter­
nally while leaving the command grids independent. Conversely, the tetrode with
targeted beams, is more evolved than Lee de Forest’s triode, because it is the real­
ization of a development, the refinement of a primitive schema of the flow of the
electrons’ modulation by fixed or variable electric fields.
The primitive triode has a greater degree of indeterminacy than modern elec­
tronic tubes, because the interactions between structural elements during the
course of its functioning are not defined, except for a single one among them,
namely the modulating function of the electric field created by the command
grid. The inconveniences that emerge of their own accord during functioning are
transformed into stable functions by the successive specifications and closures of the
system: the necessity for the grid’s negative polarization to counteract heating and
secondary emissions also contains the possibility of splitting the primitive grid’s
function into that of both a command grid and an accelerating grid; in a tube with
an accelerating grid, the command grid’s negative polarization can be reduced to
a few volts, and in some cases one volt; the command grid becomes almost exclu­
sively a command grid: its function is more efficient and the tube’s gain increases.
3.

Not entirely because each grid can modulate all the way, whereas with two lamps, it would be halfway.

36

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

The command grid is brought closer to the cathode; conversely, the second grid,
the screen, moves farther away and establishes itself roughly at an equidistance
between the anode and cathode. At the same time functioning becomes stricter;
the dynamic system closes in on itself just as an axiomatic saturates. The first tri­
odes gain could be regulated through the potentiometric variation of a cathodes
heating voltage, acting on the density of electron flow; this possibility is barely
available anymore in pentodes with a large gain, whose characteristics would be
profoundly altered by an appreciable variation in the heating voltage supply.
It seems contradictory, of course, to affirm that the evolution of the technical
object obeys both a process of differentiation (the triode's command grid is divided
into three grids within the pentode) and a process of concretization, where each
structural element fulfills several functions rather than a single one; but these two
processes are in fact tied to each other; differentiation is possible because, in a
conscious and calculated manner and in view of a necessary result, it enables the
integration of correlative effects of the global functioning into the functioning of
the ensemble, effects which had until then been more or less corrected by pallia­
tives that were separate from the principle function.
The same type of evolution is noticeable in the passage from the Crookes tube
to the Coolidge tube; the first is not only less efficient than the second; it is also
less stable in its functioning, and more complex; the Crookes tube in fact uses the
cathode-anode voltage to disassociate molecules or atoms of mono-atomic gases
into positive ions and electrons, in order to then accelerate these electrons, con­
ferring upon them an important amount of kinetic energy prior to their collision
with the anticathode; conversely, in a Coolidge tube, the function of producing
electrons is dissociated from that of the acceleration of already produced electrons;
production is achieved through a thermoelectric effect (improperly called thermi­
onic, probably because it replaces the production of electrons through ionization),
and subsequently acceleration takes place; the functions are thus purified by their
dissociation, and the corresponding structures are both more distinct and richer;
the hot cathode of a Coolidge tube is richer from the point of view of its struc­
ture and its function than the cold cathode in a Crookes tube; and yet it is also
a perfect cathode from the electrostatic point of view; all the more so since it has
a rather narrow localization of the source of thermo-electrons, and the form of
the cathode's surface surrounding the filament determines an electrostatic gradient
that enables focalization of the electrons in a narrow beam falling onto the anode
(a few square millimeters in current tubes); a Crookes tube, on the contrary, does
not have a defined location narrow enough for the source of electrons that would

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

37

enable it to focalize a beam efficiently and thus obtain a source o f X-rays nearing
the ideal punctuality.
Moreover, the presence o f ionizable gas in a Crookes tube not only had the
inconvenience of being unstable (the hardening o f the tube from a fixation of mol­
ecules on the electrodes; the necessity o f contriving valves in order to reintroduce
gas into the tube); the presence o f the gas also brought with it another essential
inconvenience: the gas molecules became an obstacle for electrons that had already
been produced and which were in the process o f acceleration within the electri­
cal field between the cathode and the anode; this inconvenience offers a typical
example o f a functional antagonism within the processes o f an abstract technical
object’s functioning: the very gas that is necessary to produce the electrons that are
to be accelerated becomes an obstacle to their acceleration. This antagonism disap­
pears with the Coolidge tube, which is a deep vacuum tube. It disappears because
the groups o f synergetic functions are allocated to specific structures; each struc­
ture attains a greater functional wealth from this redistribution as well as a more
perfect structural precision; this is the case for the cathode, which, rather than
being a simple spherical cap or hemisphere made o f any kind o f metal, becomes
an ensemble consisting o f a parabolic bowl at the heart o f which there is a filament
producing thermo-electrons; the anode, which in the Crookes tube occupied an
indifferent position with respect to the cathode, converges geometrically with the
previous anticathode; the new anode-anticathode plays the two synergetic roles:
that of the production o f a potential difference with respect to the cathode (the role
of the anode) and that o f the obstacle against which the electrons, accelerated by
differential potential, collide, thus transforming their kinetic energy into luminous
energy of a very short wavelength.
These two functions are synergetic because it is only after having sustained the
entirety of the potential drop of the electric field that the electrons acquire max­
imum kinetic energy; it is thus both at this moment and in this location that it
becomes possible to extract the greatest electromagnetic energy by stopping them
abruptly. The new anode-cathode finally plays a role in the evacuation o f heat
produced (as a result of the poor efficiency of the transformation of the electrons
kinetic energy into electromagnetic energy, roughly 1%) and this new function is
fulfilled in perfect accord with the two previous ones: a plate of hard-to-fuse metal,
such as tungsten, is embedded into the bevel-sawed solid copper bar that forms the
anode-cathode at the point of impact of the electron beam; the heat that develops
on this plate is conducted outside the tube via the copper bar, which extends to the
outside as cooling fins.

38

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

There is a synergy between the three functions, as the electric characteristics of
the highly conductive copper bar goes hand in hand with the thermal character­
istics o f this same bar as a heat conductor; furthermore, the beveled section of the
copper bar satisfies the function of a target-obstacle (anticathode), the acceleration
o f electrons (anode) and the evacuation of produced heat. One could say that,
under these conditions, the Coolidge tube is a Crookes tube that is both simplified
and concretized, in which each structure fulfills a greater but synergetic number of
functions. The imperfection of the Crookes tube, its abstract and artisanal aspect,
requiring frequent touch-ups in its functioning, came from the antagonism of func­
tions fulfilled by the rarefied gas; it is this gas which is eliminated in the Coolidge
tube. The fuzzy, indefinite structure corresponding to the ionization is entirely
replaced by the new thermoelectric aspect of the cathode, which is perfectly clear
and quantitatively adjustable.
These two examples tend to show that differentiation goes in the same direction
as the condensation of multiple functions within the same structure, because the
differentiation o f structures within a system of reciprocal causalities allows one
to suppress side-effects that were hitherto obstacles (by integrating them into the
functioning). The specialization of each structure is a specialization of a synthetic
positive functional unit, freed from undesired side-effects that affect functioning;
the technical object progresses by way of an internal redistribution of functions
into compatible units, replacing the contingency or antagonism of the primitive
distribution; specialization does not occur fon ction after fon ction , but synergy after
synergy, it is the synergetic group of functions and not the unique function that
constitutes the true sub-system in the technical object. It is because of this search
for synergies that the technical object's concretization can translate into an element
o f simplification; the concrete technical object is one that is no longer in conflict
with itself, one in which no side-effect is detrimental to the functioning of the
ensemble or left out of this functioning. In this manner and for this reason a func­
tion can be fulfilled by several synergistically associated structures in the technical
object that has become concrete, whereas in the primitive and abstract technical
object each structure is charged with the accomplishment of a definite function,
and generally only one. The essence of the technical objects concretization is the
organization of functional sub-ensembles within the total functioning; on the basis
of this principle one can understand in what sense the redistribution of functions
occurs in the network of different structures, both in the abstract technical object
and in the concrete technical object: each structure fulfills several functions; but
in the abstract technical object, it only fulfills one essential and positive function,

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

39

integrated into the functioning of the ensemble; in the concrete technical object,
all the functions fulfilled by the structure are positive, essential, and integrated
into the functioning o f the whole; the marginal consequences of the functioning,
eliminated or attenuated in the abstract technical object by corrective measures,
become stages or positive aspects in the concrete object; the schema of function­
ing incorporates marginal aspects; consequences that were irrelevant or harmful
become chain-links in its functioning.
This progress presupposes that the engineer consciously endows each structure
with characteristics that correspond to all the components of its functioning, as if
there were no difference between the artificial object and a physical system studied
from the point of view of all knowable aspects of exchanges of energy, as well as
physical and chemical transformations; each piece, in the concrete object, is no
longer simply that which essentially corresponds to the accomplishment of a func­
tion desired by the builder, but part of a system where a multitude of forces act
and produce effects that are independent of the fabricating intention. The concrete
technical object is a physico-chemical system in which reciprocal actions take place
according to all the laws of the sciences. The objective of the technical intention
can attain perfection in the construction of an object only if it becomes identical to
universal scientific knowledge. It should be emphasized that this latter knowledge
must indeed be universal, because the fact that the technical object belongs to the
class of fabricated objects, answering to this particular human need, does not in
turn limit and in no way defines the type of physico-chemical actions that can
occur in this object or between this object and the outside world. The difference
between the technical object and the physico-chemical system studied as an object
only resides within the imperfection of the sciences; the scientific knowledge that
serves as a guide to predicting the universality o f reciprocal actions exerted within
the technical system is still affected by a certain imperfection; it doesn’t allow for
an absolute prediction with rigorous precision of all effects; this is why a certain
distance remains between the system of technical intentions corresponding to a
defined objective and the scientific system of knowledge of causal interactions that
realize this objective; the technical object is never fully known; for this very reason,
it is never completely concrete, unless it happens through a rare chance occur­
rence. The ultimate allocation of functions to structures and the exact calculation
of structures could only be accomplished if the scientific knowledge of all phenom­
ena likely to exist in the technical object were completely acquired; since this is not
the case, a certain difference subsists between the technical scheme of the object
(containing the representation of a human objective) and the scientific picture

40

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

of phenomena for which it is the base (containing only schemas of reciprocal or
recurrent efficient causality).
The concretization o f technical objects is conditioned by way of narrowing the
interval that separates the sciences and technology; the primitive artisanal phase is
characterized by a weak correlation between the sciences and technology, whereas
the industrial phase is characterized by a strong correlation. The construction of
a determinate technical object can only become industrial when this object has
become concrete, which means that it is known in an almost identical manner
according to the intention of construction and according to the scientific view.
This explains the fact that certain objects could be manufactured in an industrial
manner well before others, a winch, a hoist, snatch blocks, and a hydraulic press
are technical objects in which, for the most part, the phenomena of friction, elec­
trical charging, electrodynamic induction, thermal and chemical exchanges can be
neglected without leading to the destruction or malfunction of the object; rational
classical mechanics are sufficient for a scientific knowledge of the principal phe­
nomena that characterize the functioning o f these objects we call simple machines:
however, it would have been impossible to industrially manufacture a centrifugal
gas pump or a thermal engine in the seventeenth century. The first industrially pro­
duced thermal engine, which was the Newcomen atmospheric engine, simply used
the process of depression, because the phenomenon of the condensation of steam
under the influence of cooling was scientifically known. Electrostatic machines
also remained artisanal nearly to the present day, because the phenomena of the
production and transport of charges via dielectrics and then flowing of charges via
the Corona effect, which had been qualitatively known since at least the eighteenth
century, had not yet been subjected to rigorous scientific study; after the Wimshurst
machine, even the Van de Graaff generator retained something artisanal, despite its
large size and greater power.

III. — The rhythm o f technical progress; continuous a n d minor
improvements; discontinuous a n d m ajor improvements

It is thus essentially the discovery of functional synergies that characterizes progress
in the development of the technical object. It is appropriate to ask, then, whether
this discovery takes place all at once or in a continuous manner. In terms of the
reorganization of structures affecting functioning, it happens abruptly, but can
contain several successive stages; the Coolidge tube, for instance, could not have

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

41

been conceived of before Fleming’s discovery of the production of electrons by a
heated metal; and yet Coolidge’s static anode-anticathode tube is not necessarily
the last version of a tube that produces X-rays or gamma rays. It can be improved
and appropriated for more specific uses. An important refinement, for instance,
enabling the acquisition of a source of X-rays closer to the ideal geometric point,
consisted in employing a solid anode plate, mounted on an axis within the tube:
this plate can be set in motion by a magnetic field created by an inductor placed
outside the tube and in relation to which the plate is a rotor containing an arma­
ture; the region of impact of electrons becomes a circular line close to the edge
of the copper plate, and thus offers ample possibilities for thermal dissipation;
however, the place where impact takes place is fixed, in a static and geometric
manner, with respect to the cathode and the tube: the beam of X-rays thus comes
from a geometrically fixed source, even though the anticathode rotates at high
speed within this fixed point. Tubes with a rotating anode allow for an increase in
power without increasing the size o f the region of impact, or for a reduction in the
size of the region of impact without diminishing the power; yet this rotating anode
fulfills the functions of acceleration and absorption of electrons as perfectly as a
fixed anode; it better fulfills the function of the evacuation of heat, which allows
for an improvement of optical characteristics of the tube for a determinate degree
of power.
Should one therefore consider the invention of the rotating anode to be a struc­
tural concretization of the Coolidge tube? — No, because it mostly plays the role
of diminishing an inconvenience that couldn’t be converted into a positive effect
of the overall functioning [fonctionnement d'ensemble]. The inconvenience of the
Coolidge tube, the residual aspect of antagonism that subsists in its functioning,
is the poor yield of its conversion of kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation;
this poor yield probably does not constitute a direct antagonism between func­
tions, but it does practically convert into a real antagonism; if the tungsten plate
and the copper bar’s melting point were infinitely high, then one could achieve
the concentration of a very fine, powerful beam of very rapid electrons; but as the
melting temperature for tungsten is in fact attained very quickly, one is limited by
this poor yield producing a large quantity of heat, and one must resign oneself to
sacrificing either the concentration of the beam, the density of electron flow, or the
speed of electrons, which means sacrificing the punctuality of the X-rays’ source,
the quantity of radiated electromagnetic energy or the penetration of produced
X-rays. If it were possible to discover a way of increasing the yield of energy trans­
formation that takes place on the anticathode piece, all the characteristics of the

42

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Coolidge tube would be improved, thereby removing or diminishing the greatest
antagonisms that subsist in this way of functioning. (A much weaker antagonism
consists in the fact that the beam cannot be rigorously concentrated, because of the
mutual repulsion of electrons, since they are affected by an electric charge with the
same sign; this could be compensated for by way of devices aimed at a concentra­
tion comparable to those o f either the cathode-ray oscilloscopes, or the electrostatic
or electromagnetic lenses of electronic microscopes.) The rotating anode allows for
a reduction of the consequences of the antagonism between precision and power,
between optical and electronic characteristics.
There are thus two types o f refinement: those which modify the distribution
of functions, increasing the synergy o f functioning in an essential way, and those
which, without modifying this distribution, diminish the nocuous consequences
o f residual antagonisms; a more regular system of lubrication in the engine, the
use of self-lubricating bearings, this order o f minor improvements includes the
use of more resistant metals or of more solid assemblages. The discovery of the
high emission power o f certain oxides or metals, such as thorium, has thus made
it possible to build oxide cathodes that work at lower temperatures and absorb less
heating energy for the same density of electron flux in the electronic tube. However
important this refinement may be in practice, it nevertheless remains minor, and
is suitable only for certain types of electronic tubes because of the fragility of the
oxide coating. The rotating anode of Coolidge's high power tube is another minor
refinement; it provisionally replaces a major improvement which would consist
in discovering high yield energy transformation, thus enabling a reduction of the
power deployed to accelerate electrons to a few hundred watts, which in radiogra­
phy tubes is currently on the order of several kilowatts.
In this sense, one can say that minor improvements obstruct major improve­
ments, because they may mask the technical objects true imperfections by
compensating for true antagonisms with an inessential artifice that is incompletely
integrated into the functioning of the ensemble; the danger of abstraction recurs
once again at the level of minor improvements; for instance, the Coolidge tube
with a rotating anode is less concrete than a tube with static cooling facilitated by
a copper bar and air cooling fins; if, for whatever reason, the rotation of the anode
stops during the tubes functioning, the point receiving the concentrated beam
of electrons in the anode will almost instantaneously melt and the whole tube
would be damaged; this analytical aspect of functioning thus requires new kinds
of adjustment, a safety system based on the conditioning of one functioning by
means of another functioning; in the analyzed case, the generator of anodic voltage

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

43

must be capable of functioning only if the anode is already rotating; power to the
transformer that supplies the anode voltage is controlled by the passage of current
to the inductor for the anode motor, through a relay; however, this subordination
does not completely reduce the analytic distance introduced by the rotating anode
device; current may pass into the inductor while the anode may not be effectively
rotating, due, for instance, to a weakening o f its axis; the transmitter may also stay
switched on even if the inductor is not live.
An extreme complication and refinement of ancillary safety or compensation
systems can only tend toward an equivalence with the concrete technical object
without attaining or even preparing for it, because the path chosen is not that of
concretization. The path of minor improvements is one of detours, which may be
useful in some cases for practical use, but they hardly make the technical object
evolve. By dissimulating the true schematic essence of each technical object behind
a pile of complex palliatives, minor improvements entertain a false consciousness
of a continuous progress of technical objects, diminishing the value and feel­
ing of urgency for essential transformations. For this reason, continuous minor
improvements present no clear-cut frontier with respect to this false novelty that
commerce demands in order to present a more recent object as being superior to
older ones. Minor improvements can be so nonessential as to allow for the cyclical
rhythm of fashionable forms to superimpose itself over the essential shapes of
use objects.
Therefore, it is not enough to say that the technical object is that for which there
is a specific genesis proceeding from the abstract to the concrete; the point has to
be made that this genesis occurs because of essential, discontinuous improvements,
as a result of which the internal schema of the technical object is modified in leaps
rather than following a continuous line. This does not mean that the development
of the technical object happens by chance and outside any assignable meaning; on
the contrary, the minor improvements are, to a certain extent, those which occur
by chance, overcharging the pure shapes o f the essential technical object with their
uncoordinated proliferation. The true stages of the technical objects improvement
occur through mutations, but through mutations which are oriented: the Crookes
tube contains the potential for the Coolidge tube, since the intention that orga­
nizes and stabilizes itself in the Coolidge tube by purifying itself, pre-existed in
the Crookes tube, in a confused yet real state. A great many abandoned technical
objects are unfinished inventions that remain as an open virtuality and could be
taken up again, prolonged in another domain, according to their deep intention,
their technical essence.

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS
- Absolute origins o f the technical lineage

As with any evolution, that o f technical objects poses the problem of its absolute
origins: what is the first term one can attribute to the birth of a specific technical
reality? Before the pentode and tetrode there was Lee de Forest’s triode; before Lee
de Forest’s triode there was the diode. But what was there before the diode? Is the
diode an absolute origin? Not entirely; thermoelectric emission, of course, was
unknown, but the phenomena of the transfer of charges in space via an electric
field had been known for a long time: electrolysis had been known for a century,
and the ionization of gases for several decades; thermionic emission is necessary
for the diode as a technical schema, because the diode wouldn’t be a diode if there
were reversibility of the transfer of electric charges; this reversibility doesn’t exist
in normal conditions, because one of the electrodes is hot, and therefore emissive,
and the other cold, and therefore non-emissive; what makes a diode essentially a
diode, a two way valve, is the fact that the hot electrode can be either cathode or
anode almost indifferently, whereas the cold electrode can only be an anode since
it cannot emit electrons; it can only attract, if it is positive, but not emit, even if
it is negative with respect to another electrode. If one applies external voltage to
the electrodes, a current will flow as a result of the thermoelectronic effect if the
cathode is negative with respect to the anode, whereas no current will flow if the
hot electrode is positive with respect to the cold electrode. It is this discovery of a
condition of functional dissymmetry between the electrodes that constitutes the
diode, and not, properly speaking, that of a transfer of electrical charges through
a vacuum mediated by an electric field: experiments with ionization of monoatomic gases had already shown that free electrons can move in an electric field; but
this phenomenon is reversible, not polarized; if the tube of purified gas is turned
upside down, then the positive column and luminous rings change sides in relation
to the tube, but remain on the same side in relation to the direction of current
coming from the generator. The diode is made up of the association of this revers­
ible phenomenon of the transfer of electric charges by a field and the condition of
irreversibility created by the fact that the production of transferable electric charges
is the production of a single kind of (only negative) electric charges and by only
one o f the two electrodes, the hot electrode; the diode is a vacuum tube in which
there is a hot electrode and a cold electrode, between which an electric field is cre­
ated. What we have here is indeed an absolute beginnings residing in the association
of this condition of irreversibility of the electrodes and of this phenomenon of

transfer of electric charges through a vacuum: it is a technical essence that is created.
The diode is an asymmetrical conductance.
Nevertheless one should note that this essence is larger than the definition of the
Fleming valve; several other procedures have been discovered for the creation of
asymmetrical conductance; the contact between galena and metal, between copper
and copper oxide, between selenium and another metal, between germanium and
a tungsten tip, and between crystallized silicon and a metal tip are asymmetrical
conductances. In the end, a single photoelectric cell can be considered a diode,
since the photoelectrons behave like thermoelectrons in the vacuum o f a cell (in
the case of a vacuum cell, and also in that of a gas cell, but the phenomenon is com­
plicated by the emission of secondary electrons in addition to the photoelectrons).
Should the name diode then be reserved for the Fleming valve? Technically, the
Fleming valve can be replaced in several applications, by germanium diodes (for
low intensities with high frequencies) or by a selenium or cupric oxide rectifier, for
applications with low frequency and high intensity. Usage, however, does not offer
good criteria: one could also replace the Fleming valve with a rotating converter,*
which is a technique whose essential schema is entirely different from that of the
diode. As a matter of fact, the thermoelectric diode constitutes a definite genus,
which has its own historical existence; beyond this genus there is a p u re schema o f
functioning that is transposable to other structures, for instance that o f imperfect
or semi-conductors; the schema of functioning is the same to such an extent that
one can indicate a diode on a theoretical schematization with a sign (asymmetri­
that does not predetermine the type of diode
cal conductance:
employed, leaving a freedom of choice to the manufacturer. H owever, the pure
technical schema defines a type of existence of the technical object, grasped in its
ideal function, which is different from the reality of a historic type; historically,
the Fleming diode is closer to Lee de Forest s triode than to a germanium rectifier,
to cupric oxide, or selenium and iron, which are nonetheless signaled by the same
schematic symbols and in some cases fulfill the same functions to the point of
being substitutable for the Fleming diode. This is because the whole essence of the
Fleming valve is not reducible to its aspect of asymmetrical conductance; it is also
that which produces and transfers a flow of electrons that can be slowed down,
accelerated or deviated, as well as dispersed or concentrated, repulsed or attracted;
the technical object exists not only as a result of its functioning within external
devices (asymmetrical conductance), but through phenomena for which it is in
itself the basis: this is where its fecundity comes from, a non-saturation giving it
posterity.

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

The primitive technical object can be considered a non-saturated system: any
ulterior improvements it receives intervene as progress of the system toward sat­
uration; viewed from the outside, one could think that the technical object alters
and changes its structure rather than improving itself. But one could say that the
technical object evolves by generating a family: the primitive object is the ancestor
of this family. Such evolution could be called a n atu ral technical evolution . In this
sense, the gas engine is an ancestor of the gasoline engine and the diesel engine; the
Crookes tube is the ancestor of the Coolidge tube; the diode is the ancestor of the
triode and other tubes with multiple electrodes.
At the origin o f each of these series, there is a definite act of invention; the gas
engine follows, in a sense, from the steam engine; the disposition of its cylinder,
of its piston, of its system of transmission, of its distribution by valves and ports
is analogous to that of the steam engine; but it comes about by way of the steam
engine like the diode comes about by way of the discharge tube through ionization
in gases: what was needed was also a new phenomenon, a schema that did not
previously exist either in the steam engine, or in the gas discharge tube; in the
steam engine both the boiler producing gas under pressure and the source of heat
were external to the cylinder; in the gas engine, it is the cylinder itself that, as a
combustion chamber, becomes both boiler and firebox: combustion takes place
inside the cylinder, it is an internal combustion; in the gas discharge tube, elec­
trodes were indifferent, as conductance remained symmetrical; the discovery of
the thermoelectronic effect allows for the construction of a tube that is analogous
to the gas discharge tube in which the electrons are polarized, and which in turn
renders conductance asymmetrical. The beginning of a lineage of technical objects
is marked by this synthetic act of invention constitutive of a technical essence.
A technical essence can be recognized by the fact that it remains stable across
the evolving lineage, and not only stable, but also productive of structures and
functions through internal development and progressive saturation; this is how
the technical essence of the internal combustion engine was able to become that
of the diesel engine, through additional concretization of its functioning: in the
previous carburized engine, the heating of the carburized mix in the cylinder at
the moment of compression is nonessential or even detrimental, since it risks
producing a detonation instead of producing a deflagration (combustion with a
progressive explosive wave), which limits the admissible compression ratio for a
given type of fuel; this heating through compression, conversely, becomes essential
and positive in the diesel engine, since this is what produces the beginning of defla­
gration; this positive aspect o f the role of compression is obtained through a greater

THE PROCESS OF CONORETIZATION

47

precision of the determination of the moment in which carburetion must inter­
vene in the cycle: in the previous carburized engine, carburetion could take place at
any indeterminate moment before the introduction of the carburized mix into the
cylinder: in the diesel engine, carburetion must take place after the introduction
and compression of pure air, free of fuel vapors, at the moment in which the piston
passes the top dead-center, because this introduction provokes the beginning of
deflagration (the beginning of the power stroke in the cycle) and cannot provoke
it unless it takes place at the moment in which, at the end of compression, the air
attains its highest temperature; the introduction of fuel into the air (carburetion) is
thus far more charged with functional significance in the diesel engine than in the
gasoline engine; it is being integrated into a more saturated, more rigorous system,
which allows the manufacturer less freedom and the user less tolerance. The triode
is also a system that is more saturated than the diode; in the diode, asymmetrical
conductance is limited only by thermoelectric emission: when the cathode-anode
voltage is increased, internal current increases more and more for a given tempera­
ture of the cathode, but reaches a ceiling (saturation current), which corresponds
to the fact that all electrons emitted by the cathode are captured by the anode.
One can thus regulate the current traversing a diode only by varying anodic
voltage; on the contrary, the triode is a system in which one can vary the current
traversing the anode-cathode space in a continuous manner without varying the
anode-cathode voltage; the primitive property (the variation of current in direct
relation to the anode-cathode voltage) subsists, but is accompanied by a second
possibility of variation, which is determined by the command grid voltage; the
function of variation that primitively adhered to the anode's voltage, becomes an
individualized, free and defined property, which adds an element to the system
and consequently saturates it, since the regime of causalities now comprises an
additional component; this saturation of the system through the segregation of
functions becomes intensified throughout the course of the evolution of a tech­
nical object; in the pentode, the current that traverses the cathode-anode space
becomes independent of the anodes voltage for values of the anode’s voltage
between a very low minimum and a high maximum, defined by the possibility of
thermal dissipation; this aspect is stable enough to allow utilization of a pentode
as a load resistor in relaxation oscillators* that have to produce linear saw-tooth
waves for voltages with horizontal deviation in cathode-ray oscillographs; in this
case, the screen voltage, command grid voltage, and the third (suppressor) grid
remain fixed. Conversely, in the triode, for a given voltage in the command grid,
the anodic current varies according to the anode’s voltage: in this sense, the triode

48

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

is still comparable to a diode, whereas this is no longer the case for the pentode in a
dynamic state; this difference results from the fact that in the triode, the anode still
plays an ambivalent role as both an electrode that captures electrons (a dynamic
role) and as an electrode that creates an electric field (a static role); conversely, in
the tetrode or pentode, the maintenance of the electric field, which regulates the
flow o f electrons, is taken care of by the command grid, which plays the role of an
electrostatic anode; the anode plate simply retains the role of capturing electrons;
for this reason, the gain of the pentode can be much greater than that of the triode,
because the function of maintaining the field o f electrostatic acceleration is ensured
without variation or weakening (since the screen has a fixed potential), even when
the anodic voltage lessens as the current increases, because of insertion of a load
resistor in the anodic circuit. One could say that both the tetrode and the pentode
eliminate the antagonism that exists in the triode between the function of acceler­
ation o f electrons by the anode and the function of capturing the electric charges
transported by the electrons, which are accelerated by the same anode, a function
which entails a drop in anodic potential when a load resistor is introduced and
diminishes the acceleration of electrons. From this point of view, the screen grid
must be considered an electrostatic anode with fixed voltage.
One can therefore see that the tetrode and pentode are both the result of the
saturation and synergetic concretization of the triodes primitive schema. The
screen-grid concentrates within itself all of the functions relating to the electro­
static field, which correspond to the preservation of a fixed potential; the command
grid and anode preserve only the functions relating to a variable potential, which
they can thus fulfill to a greater extent (during functioning the anode of a pentode
deployed as a voltage amplifier can be brought to potentials varying between 30
and 300 volts in a dynamical state); the command grid captures fewer electrons
than a triode, which enables one to treat its input impedance as very high: the com­
mand grid increasingly becomes a pure command grid no longer exposed to the
continuous current created by the captivating of electrons; it is, more rigorously
speaking, an electrostatic structure. One can thus consider the pentode and tetrode
as direct descendants of the triode, since they realize the development of its internal
technical schema by reducing incompatibilities via the redistribution of functions
into synergetic subsystems. It is the latency and stability of the concrete schema of
organizational invention throughout its successive developments that ground the
unity and distinctiveness of a technological lineage.

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

49

Concretization gives the technical object an intermediate place between the nat­
ural object and scientific representation. The abstract technical object, in other
words the primitive technical object, is far from constituting a natural system; it
is the translation into matter of a set of notions and scientific principles that are
deeply separate from one another, which are attached only through their conse­
quences and converge for the purpose of the production of a desired effect. This
primitive technical object is not a natural, physical system, it is the physical trans­
lation of an intellectual system. For this reason, it is an application or a bundle of
applications; it comes after knowledge, and cannot teach anything; it cannot be
examined inductively like a natural object, precisely because it is artificial.
On the contrary, the concrete technical object, which is to say the evolved tech­
nical object, comes closer to the mode of existence of natural objects, tending
toward internal coherence, toward a closure of the system of causes and effects that
exert themselves in a circular fashion within its bounds, and it moreover incor­
porates a part of the natural world that intervenes as a condition of functioning,
and is thus part of the system of causes and effects. As it evolves, this object loses
its artificial character: the essential artificiality of an object resides in the fact that
man must intervene to maintain the existence o f this object by protecting it against
the natural world, giving it a status of existence that stands apart. Artificiality is
not a characteristic denoting the fabricated origin of the object in opposition to
spontaneous production in nature: artificiality is that which is internal to mans
artificializing action, whether this action intervenes on a natural object or on an
entirely fabricated one; a flower, grown in a greenhouse, which yields only petals (a
double flower) without being able to engender fruit, is the flower of an artificialized
plant: man diverted the functions of this plant from their coherent fulfillment, to
such an extent that it can no longer reproduce except through procedures such
as grafting, requiring human intervention. Rendering a natural object artificial
leads to the opposite results to that of technical concretization: the artificialized
plant can only exist in a laboratory for plants, the greenhouse, with its complex
system of thermal and hydraulic regulations. Its system of primitively coherent
biological functions has opened up into functions that are independent of one
another, and only become attached to one another through the gardeners care; its
flowering has become a pure flowering, detached, anomic; the plant flowers until
it is exhausted, without producing seeds. It loses its initial capacity of resistance
against cold, drought, and sun; the regulations of the primitively natural object
become the artificial regulations of the greenhouse. Artificialization is a process of
abstraction within the artificialized object.

50

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Conversely, technical concretization makes the primitively artificial object
increasingly similar to a natural object.4 Ib is object needed a regulative external
milieu in the beginning, the laboratory, workshop, or sometimes the factory; it
gradually increases its concretization, it becomes capable of doing without the
artificial milieu, because its internal coherence increases, its functional systematicity closes as it organizes itself. The concretized object is comparable to the
spontaneously produced object; the object frees itself from the originally associ­
ated laboratory and dynamically incorporates the laboratory into itself through
the play o f its functions; what enables the self-maintenance of the objects con­
ditions of functioning is its relation to other technical and natural objects, and it
is this relation that becomes regulative; this object is no longer isolated; it associ­
ates itself with other objects, or suffices unto itself, whereas at first it was isolated
and heteronomous.
The consequences o f this concretization are not only human and economical
(allowing decentralization, for example), they are also intellectual: since the mode
of existence o f the concretized technical object is analogous to that of natural
spontaneously produced objects, one can legitimately consider them as one would
natural objects; in other words, one can submit them to inductive study. They are
no longer mere applications of certain prior scientific principles. By existing, they
prove the viability and stability o f a certain structure that has the same status as a
natural structure, even if it might be schematically different from all natural struc­
tures. The study o f the functioning of concrete technical objects bears scientific
value, since its objects are not deduced from a single principle; they are testimony
to a certain mode o f functioning and compatibility that exists in fact and has been
built before having been planned: this compatibility was not contained in each of
the separate scientific principles that served to build the object; it was discovered
empirically; one can work backward from the acknowledgement of this compat­
ibility to the separate sciences in order to pose the problem of the correlation
of their principles and ground a science of correlations and transformations that
would be a general technology or mechanology.
However, for this general technology to make sense, one must avoid the
improper identification of the technical object with the natural object and more
specifically with the living being. External analogies, or rather resemblances, must
be rigorously banned: they have no signification and are only misleading. Dwelling
on automata is dangerous because it risks limiting one to the study of external
aspects and thereby to improper identifications. The only thing that counts is the
exchange of energy and information within the technical object or between the
4. Variant: the object frees itself and becomes naturalized. — Ed.

THE PROCESS OF CONCRETIZATION

technical object and its milieu; external behaviors as viewed by a spectator are not
objects of scientific study. One needn’t even found a separate science that would
study the mechanisms of regulation and command in automata built to be autom­
ata: technology must deal with the universality of technical objects. In this sense,
cybernetics is insufficient: it has the immense merit of being the first inductive
study of technical objects, and of presenting itself as a study of the intermedi­
ate domain between the specialized sciences; but it has specialized its domain of
investigation too narrowly, because it started from the study of a certain number
of technical objects; it accepted as its point of departure that which technology
must reject: a classification of technical objects according to criteria established
according to genera and species. Automata are not a species; there are only technical
objects, which in turn have a functional organization that results in various degrees
of automatism.
What risks making the work of cybernetics partially inefficient as an inter-sci­
entific study (which nevertheless is the objective Norbert Wiener attributes to his
research) is the initial postulate concerning the identity between living beings and
self-regulating technical objects. Yet the only thing we can say is that technical
objects tend toward concretization, whereas natural objects, such as living beings,
are concrete to begin with. One mustn’t confuse the tendency toward concret­
ization with the status of entirely concrete existence. To a certain extent, every
technical object has residual aspects of abstraction; one mustn’t go right to the limit
and speak of technical objects as if they were natural objects. Technical objects
must be studied in their evolution in order to discern the process of concretization
as a tendency; but one mustn’t isolate the last product of technical evolution in
order to declare it entirely concrete; it is more concrete than the preceding ones, yet
it is still artificial. Instead of considering one class of technical beings, automata,
one must follow the lines of concretization throughout a temporal evolution of
technical objects; it is only by following this path that the rapprochement between
the living being and the technical object makes any true sense, beyond any mythology. In the absence of any end-point thought out and realized by living human
beings on Earth, physical causality could not, in the majority of cases, have pro­
duced a positive and efficient5 concretization on its own, even though modulating
structures exist in nature (relaxation oscillators, amplifiers) — wherever metastable
states exist, and this is perhaps one of the aspects of the origins of life.

I. - Hypertely and self-conditioning in technical evolution
There are phenomena of hypertely that manifest themselves in the evolution of
technical objects, giving each technical object an exaggerated degree of specializa­
tion and maladapting it to even a slight change in the conditions of its utilization
or fabrication; the schema that constitutes the essence o f the technical object can in
fact adapt in two ways: it can first of all adapt to the material and human conditions
of production; each object can utilize the electrical, mechanical, or chemical aspects
of the materials that constitute it in the best possible way; it can then adapt to the
task for which it is made: a tire that can be used well in a cold climate may not be
appropriate for a hot climate and vice versa; a plane made for high altitudes may
be disadvantaged by the need to function temporarily at low altitudes, in particular
for landing and takeoff. The jet engine, which is superior in very high altitudes to a
propeller engine precisely because of its principle of propulsion, becomes difficult
to use at a very low altitude; the great speed attained by a jet engine becomes a
rather paralyzing aspect when it needs to touch ground; the reduction of wing area,
which comes with the use of a jet engine, requires landing at a high speed (almost
the cruising speed of a propeller aircraft), thus requiring a very long landing strip.
The first planes, which were able to land in the middle of the countryside, were
less functionally over-adapted than modern planes. Functional over-adaptation
goes so far that it results in certain schemas similar to those which in biology,
fluctuate between symbiosis and parasitism: some very fast small planes can take

54

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

off with ease only if they are carried by a bigger plane that drops them in mid­
flight; others use rockets in order to increase upward thrust. The transport glider
is itself a hypertelic technical object: it has become little more than an air cargo
ship or rather an air-barge without a tow plane, and as such, it is entirely different
from a true glider that can, after a light launch, catch the air on its own, using air
currents. The autonomous glider is very finely adapted to engineless flight, whereas
the transport glider is only one o f two asymmetrical halves of a technical totality,
the other being the tow plane; the tow plane, on the other hand, is maladapted
because it cannot, on its own, take off with a load corresponding to its power.
One could thus say that there are two types of hypertely: one corresponds to a
fine-tuned adaptation to well-defined conditions without breaking the technical
object up and without a loss o f autonomy; the other corresponds to a breaking-up
of the technical object, as in the case of the division of a unique primitive being
into tower and towed. The first case preserves the autonomy of the object, whereas
the second case sacrifices it. A mixed case o f hypertely is one that corresponds to an
adaptation to the milieu, such that the object necessitates a certain kind of milieu
in order to function properly, because it is energetically coupled to its milieu; this
case is almost identical to that of the division into tower and towed; for instance, a
clock synchronized by a grid loses all capacity for functioning if it is brought from
America to France, because o f the different frequency (60 Hertz and 50 Hertz); an
electrical motor requires a grid or generator; a synchronous single-phase motor is
more finely adapted to a determinate milieu than a universal motor; in this milieu,
it functions even better, but outside of this milieu it becomes worthless. A syn­
chronous three-phase motor is even more finely adapted to functioning in a certain
type o f grid than a single-phase motor, but outside of this grid it can no longer be
used; as a result of this limitation its functioning becomes even more satisfactory
than that of a single-phase motor (a more regular regime of functioning, high effi­
ciency, very little wear and tear, and low losses in the connecting lines).
In some cases, this adaptation to the technical milieu is primordial; the utili­
zation o f an alternative three-phase current is thus fully satisfactory in the factory
environment and for all kinds of motors regardless of their power requirements.
And yet, no one has been able to this day to use alternative three-phase current
for the traction of electric trains. A system of transfer is needed to connect and
mutually adapt the locomotive motor using direct current to the three-phase
high-voltage transportation grid: it is either the sub-station delivering direct voltage
to the feeders of the catenary or the transformers and rectifiers on the locomotive
that provide the motor with direct current, even though the catenary is subject to

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

55

alternative voltage. The locomotive motor would in fact have been constrained to
lose too great a part o f its range of utilization by adapting in terms o f its energy and
frequency to the energy distribution grid; a synchronous or asynchronous motor
provides large quantities of mechanical energy only when it has reached its design
speed; while excellent for a stationary machine like a lathe or a drill that starts up
with zero load and is only required to overcome an important degree of resistance
once the design speed is reached, this type of utilization is not suitable for the
motor of a locomotive; the locomotive starts up with a full load, with all the inertia
of its train; it is when it is functioning at operating speed (if one can speak of a
systems operating speed, strictly speaking, in the case of a locomotive) that it has
the least amount of energy to provide; the motor of a locomotive must provide
maximum energy in its transition phases, either during acceleration, or deceler­
ation, or for braking using counter-current. Rich in frequent adaptation to the
variations of the operating system, such usage is opposed to the reduction o f the
spectrum of the modes of utilization characteristic of the adaptation to a technical
milieu, for which the factory with its polyphase grid and constant frequency is an
example. The example of the traction motor allows us to grasp the existence of a
twofold relation that the technical object entertains, with its geographical milieu
on the one hand, and its technical milieu on the other.
The technical object is situated at the meeting point between two milieus, and
it must be integrated to both milieus at once. In any case, as these two milieus
are two worlds that do not belong to the same system and are not necessarily
completely compatible, the technical object is to a certain extent determined by
human choice, attempting to realize the best possible compromise between these
two worlds. In a sense, a traction motor, like a factory motor, is what is fed by the
energy of high voltage alternative three-phase lines; in another sense, it is what
deploys its energy to pull a train, from stop to full speed and once again to a full
halt, via degrees of decreasing speed; it is what must pull the train on its ramps,
through turns, and on slopes, while maintaining its speed as constant as possible.
The traction motor not only transforms electrical energy into mechanical energy;
it applies it to a varied geographical world, which translates technically into the
shape of the tracks, the variable resistance of the wind, the resistance of snow that
the front of the locomotive pushes out of the way. The traction motors reaction
rebounds on the line that feeds it, creating a reaction that is the translation of
this geographical and meteorological structure of the world: the absorbed intensity
increases and the voltage in the line decreases when the snow thickens, when the
slope rises, when lateral wind pushes the wheels’ guards against the tracks and

56

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

increases friction. The two w orlds a c t upon each other v iz the traction motor. A threephase factory motor, on the contrary, does not establish a reciprocal relation of
causality between the technical world and the geographical world in the same way;
its operation takes place almost entirely within the technical world. The uniqueness
o f this milieu explains why there is no need for an adaptation milieu in the case of
the factory motor, whereas the traction motor requires an adaptation milieu such
as is constituted by the rectifiers, which are placed in the sub-station or on top of
the locomotive; the factory motor requires only the transformer as an adaptation
milieu that lowers voltage, which could be done away for high powered engines,
and is necessary in the case of average power engines, as a safety requirement aimed
at human users, rather than as a true adaptor to the milieu.
Adaptation follows a different curve and has a different sense in this third case;
it cannot lead as directly to phenomena of hypertely and maladaptation following
hypertely. The necessity o f adaptation, not to a milieu defined as exclusive, but to
the function of relating two milieus that are both evolving, limits adaptation and
gives it more precision in the direction of autonomy and concretization. This is
where true technical progress resides. Thus the use of silicon plates, having greater
magnetic permeability and lower hysteresis than iron plates, facilitates a reduction
of both the weight and volume o f traction motors even while it increases their
efficiency; such modifications tend toward a function of mediation between the
technical and geographical worlds, since a locomotive can now have a lower center
of gravity, with its motors often located at the level of the bogies; the inertia of the
rotor is reduced, which is desirable for the sake of rapid braking. The use of silicon
insulation makes greater heat tolerable without the risk of deteriorating the insula­
tion, which in turn increases the possibilities of over-intensity, increasing the motor
torque during start-up and the resistant torque during braking. Such modifications
do not restrain, but rather extend the areas whereby traction motors can be used.
A motor insulated with silicon can be used without supplementary precaution in
a locomotive climbing steep slopes or in a very hot climate; the engine s relational
use extends itself; (a small version of) this type of improved motor can be used as a
truck speed-reducer; the motor is in fact adapted to the relational modality as such
and not only to this precise type of relation that links the grid and the geographical
world for the purpose of the trains traction.

An analogous example of concretization is the Guimbal turbine6; this turbine is
immersed in the penstock and directly coupled to a very small generator contained
in a crankcase filled with pressurized oil. The dam wall thus contains an entire
electrical factory within the penstock, since the only thing that appears at groundlevel is the gatehouse containing the oil reservoir and measuring instruments. The
water becomes pluri-functional: it conveys energy by activating the turbine and
generator and also transfers heat from the generator; the oil is also remarkably
pluri-functional: it lubricates the generator, insulates the windings, and transfers
the generated heat from the winding to the crankcase where it is evacuated by
the water; lastly, it prevents the seepage of water into the crankcase through the
shaft packings, since the pressure of the oil in the box is greater than the pressure
of the water outside the box. This over-pressure is itself pluri-functional; under
permanent pressure it greases the bearings while at the same time preventing the
water from seeping into the bearings if they fail to be watertight. However, it is
worth noting that it is as a result of this pluri-functionality that this concretization
and relational adaptation became, possible. To put the generator into a penstock
containing the turbine was unthinkable prior to Guimbals invention, because
even if the problem of water-tightness and insulation were supposedly solved, the
generator was too large to be lodged within the conduit; it is the mode of resolu­
tion of the problems of water-tightness and electric insulation that allows for the
insertion of the generator into the conduit, while also facilitating excellent cooling
through the double intermediary of both oil and water. One could go so far as
to say that the insertion of the generator into the conduit renders itse lf possible by
simultaneously authorizing the energetic cooling by water. Additionally, the great
efficiency of cooling allows for a considerable reduction of size while maintaining
the same power. The Guimbal generator would be rapidly destroyed by heat if it
were used at full load and out in open air, whereas it barely registers any increase
in temperature within its double pool of concentric oil and water, both of which
pulsate energetically, the oil according to the generators movement of rotation,
and the water according to the turbulence of the turbine. Concretization is here
conditioned by an invention that presupposes the problem to be resolved, indeed it
is due to the new conditions created by concretization that this concretization is
possible; the only milieu in relation to which there is non-hypertelic adaptation, is
the milieu created by adaptation itself; here the act of adaptation is not merely an

can pump water during low tide with low energy expense.

58

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

act o f adaptation in the sense in which this word defines the adaptation to a milieu
that is already given prior to the process of adaptation.
Adaptation-concretization is a process that conditions the birth of a milieu
rather than being conditioned by an already given milieu; it is conditioned by a
milieu that only exists virtually before invention; there is invention because there is
a leap that takes place and is justified by means of the relation that it brings about
within the milieu that it creates: the condition of possibility of this turbo-generator
couple is its realization; it can only be geometrically situated in the conduit if it is
physically situated in such a way that it realizes the thermal exchanges that allow
for a reduction of its size. One could say that a concretizing invention realizes a
techno-geographic milieu (in this case the oil and water in turbulence), which in
turn is a condition o f possibility o f the technical object’s functioning. The technical
object is thus its own condition, as a condition o f existence o f this m ixed m ilieu which
is simultaneously both technical and geographical. This phenomenon of self­
conditioning defines the principle according to which the development of technical
objects is made possible without a tendency toward hypertely and then maladaptation; hypertely occurs when adaptation is relative to a given that exists prior
to the process o f adaptation; such adaptation effectively seeks conditions that
always outpace it, because its reaction does not impact them and in turn doesn’t
condition them.
The evolution o f technical objects can only become progress insofar as these tech­
nical objects are free in their evolution and not pushed by necessity in the direction
of a fatal hypertely. For this to be possible, the evolution of technical objects must
be constructive, which is to say that it calls forth the creation of this third techno-geographic milieu wherein each modification is self-conditioned. Indeed, this is
not about a form o f progress conceived as a march in a direction fixed in advance,
nor about a humanization of nature; this progress could just as well present itself
as a naturalization of man; between man and nature a techno-geographical milieu
arises that only becomes possible through man’s intelligence: the self-conditioning
o f a schema as a result of its functioning necessarily requires the use of an inventive
function of anticipation, which cannot be found in nature or in already constituted
technical objects; thus a vital work [une œuvre de vie\ is required to take the leap
beyond a given reality and its current systematization, toward new forms that only
maintain themselves because they exist all together as a constituted system; when
a new organ appears in the evolving series, it maintains itself only if it realizes a
systematic and pluri-functional convergence. The organ is its own condition. It is
in a similar manner that the geographical world and the world of already existing

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

technical objects enter into a relation in which concretization is organic, and which
defines itself through its relational function. Like an arch that is stable only once
it is finished, this object that fulfills a function of relation maintains itself and is
coherent once it exists and because it exists; it creates its own associated milieu
from itself and is really individualized in it.

We can therefore affirm that the individualization of technical beings is the condi­
tion of technical progress. This individualization is made possible by the recurrence
of causality within a milieu that the technical object creates around itself and that
conditions it, just as it is conditioned by it. This simultaneously technical and nat­
ural milieu can be called an associated milieu. It is that through which the technical
object conditions itself in its functioning. This milieu is not fabricated [fab riq u é ],
or at least not fabricated in its totality; it is a certain regime of natural elements sur­
rounding the technical being, linked to a certain regime of elements that constitute
the technical being. The associated milieu mediates the relation between technical,
fabricated elements and natural elements, at the heart of which the technical being
functions. Such is the case of the ensemble constituted by oil and water moving in
and around the Guimbal turbine. This ensemble is concretized and individualized
by recurrent thermal exchanges that take place within it: the faster the turbine
spins, the more there is an increase in the heat generated by the generator through
magnetic losses and the Joule effect; but the faster the turbine spins, the greater
the increase in the turbulence of the oil around the rotor and that of the water
around the crank-case, thereby activating the thermal exchanges between rotor
and water. It is this associated milieu that is the condition of existence for the
invented technical object. The only technical objects that can be said to have been
invented, strictly speaking, are those that require an associated milieu in order to be
viable; these cannot in fact be constituted part by part via the phases of successive
evolution, because they can exist only as a whole or not at all. Technical objects
that essentially put into play a recurrent causality in their relation with the natural
7. The phrase “fond et forme” nearly always means “content and form”, and it is important to be aware that Simondon is
here employing this typical expression, but changing the content of its meaning, as soon becomes clear in the text; “fond”
here and throughout is rather used in the sense, taken from Gestalt theory, o f a “ground” or “background” against which
a form or figure can emerge - the constant with reference to which a variable can emerge - , without, however, completely
losing from view its primary meaning o f “content”. [TN]

world must be invented rather than gradually developed, because these objects are
the cause o f the condition of their functioning. These objects are viable only if the
problem is solved, i.e., only if they exist together with their associated milieu.
This is why we notice such discontinuity in the history of technical objects, with
absolute origins. Only a thought that is capable of foresight and creative imagina­
tion can accomplish such a reverse conditioning in time: the elements that will
materially constitute the technical object and which are separate from each other,
without an associated milieu prior to the constitution of the technical object, must
be organized in relation to each other according to the circular causality that will
exist once the object will have been constituted; thus what is at stake here is a
conditioning o f the present by the future, by that which is not yet. Such a futural
function is only rarely the work of chance; it requires putting into play a capacity
to organize the elements according to certain requirements which act as an ensem­
ble, as a directive value, and play the role of symbols representing the future
ensemble that does not yet exist. The unity of the future associated milieu, within
which the causal relations will be deployed that will enable the functioning of the
new technical object, is represented , it is p lay ed or acted out as much as a role can be
played in the absence of the true character, by way of the schemes of the creative
imagination. The dynamism of thought is the same as that of technical objects;
mental schemas react upon each other during invention in the same way the diverse
dynamisms of the technical object will react upon each other in their material
functioning. The unity of the technical objects associated milieu is analogous to
the unity of the living being; during invention, the unity of the living being is the
coherence of mental schemes, obtained by the fact that they exist and deploy them­
selves in the same being; those schemas that are contradictory confront and reduce
one another. The reason the living being can invent is because it is an individual
being that carries its associated milieu with it; this capacity for conditioning itself
lies at the root of the capacity to produce objects that condition themselves. What
has escaped the attention of psychologists in their analysis of the inventive imagi­
nation aren’t the schemas, forms, or operations that stand out as the spontaneously
salient and striking elements, but rather the dynamic ground upon which these
schemas confront each other and combine, and wherein they participate. Gestalt
psychology, while recognizing the function of totalities, attributed force to form; a
deeper analysis of the inventive process would no doubt show that what is determi­
nant and plays an energetic role are not forms but that which carries the forms,
which is to say their ground; the ground, while perpetually marginal with respect
to attention, is what harbors the dynamisms; it is that through which the system of

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

61

forms exists; forms do not participate in forms, but in the ground, which is the
system of all forms or rather the common reservoir of the formes’ tendencies, well
before they exist separately and constitute themselves as an explicit system. The
relation of participation that links forms to ground is a relation that bestrides the
present and diffuses an influence of the future onto the present, of the virtual onto
the actual. For the ground is the system of virtualities, of potentials, forces that
carve out their path, whereas forms are the system of actuality. Invention is the
taking charge of the system of actuality through the system of virtualities, the cre­
ation of a unique system on the basis of these two systems. Forms are passive in so
far as they represent actuality; they become active when they organize in relation to
this ground, thereby bringing prior virtualities into actuality. It is no doubt very
difficult to shed light on the modalities according to which a system of forms can
participate in a ground of virtualities. We can only say that it happens according to
the same mode of causality and conditioning as the one which exists in the relation
of each of the technical objects structures which are constituted with the dyna­
misms of the associated milieu; these structures are inside the associated milieu,
they are determined by it and, because of it, they are also determined by the other
structures of the technical being; they also partially determine it, but each one for
its own sake, while the technical milieu, which is determined separately by each
structure, in turn determines them altogether by providing the energetic, thermal
and chemical conditions of functioning. There is a recurrence of causality between
the associated milieu and the structures, but this recurrence is not symmetrical.
The milieu plays the role o f information; it is the seat of self-regulations, the vehicle
of information or of energy that is already governed by information (for instance,
the water that is animated by more or less rapid movement, cooling the crank-box
more or less rapidly); while the associated milieu is homeostatic, the structures are
animated by a non-recurrent causality; each goes in its own direction. Freud ana­
lyzed the influence of ground on forms in psychic life by interpreting this influence
as one of hidden forms on explicit forms; hence the notion of repression.
Experiments have indeed proven that symbolization exists (experiments where a
violently emotional scene is described to a subject in a hypnotic state and who,
upon waking, recounts this scene by using symbolic transposition), but this does
not prove that the unconscious is populated by forms comparable to explicit forms.
A dynamics of tendencies is sufficient for explaining symbolization if one considers
as effective the existence of a psychic ground, upon which the explicit forms that
are generated by the conscious and wakeful state are deployed and in which they
participate. It is the milieu associated with a systematics of forms that institutes

62

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

relations of recurrent causality between these forms and that which causes recast­
ings o f the system o f forms taken as an ensemble. Alienation is the break between
ground and forms in psychic life: the associated milieu no longer regulates the
dynamism o f forms. To date, the imagination has been poorly analyzed because
forms have been invested with the privilege o f being active and are thought to have
the initiative in psychic life and in physical life. In reality there exists a great kin­
ship between life and thought: within a living organism all living matter cooperates
in life; it is not only the most apparent, or the clearest structures that have the
initiative of life in the body; blood, lymph nodes, and conjunctive tissues partake
in life; an individual is not only made up of a collection of organs combined with
one another into systems; an individual is also made up of that which is neither
organ nor structure o f living matter, insofar as it constitutes an associated milieu
for the organs; living matter is the ground of the organs; it is what allows them to
relate to each other and become an organism; it is what maintains the fundamental
thermal and chemical equilibriums upon which the organs deliver brisk, but lim­
ited variations; the organs participate in the body. The living matter in question is
far from being pure indeterminacy and pure passivity; nor is it blind aspiration: it
is the vehicle o f informed energy. In the same way, thought comprises clear, sepa­
rate structures, such as representations, images, certain memories, and certain
perceptions. All these elements, however, participate in a ground that gives them a
direction, a homeostatic unity, and which acts as a vehicle for informed energy
from one to the other and among all of them. One could say that the ground is the
implicit axiomatic; in it new systems of forms are elaborated. Without the ground
o f thought, there would be no thinking being, but rather an unrelated series of
discontinuous representations. This ground is the mental milieu associated with
the forms. It is the middle term between life and conscious thought, just as the
associated milieu o f the technical object is the middle term between natural world
and the fabricated structures of the technical object. We can create technical beings
because we have within us a play of relations and a matter-form relation that is
highly analogous to the one we constitute in the technical object. The relation
between thought and life is analogous to the relation between the structured tech­
nical object and the natural milieu. The individualized technical object is an object
that has been invented, i.e., produced through the play of recurrent causality
between life and thought in man. An object that has only been thought or only
associated with life is not a technical object, but a utensil or apparatus. It has no
internal consistency, because it has no associated milieu instituting a recurrent
causality.

III. - Technical in d iv id u alizatio n

The technical objects principle of individualization through recurrent causality
within an associated milieu enables us to think with greater clarity about certain
technical ensembles and to know whether to treat them as a technical individual
or as a collection of organized individuals. We shall speak of a technical individual whenever the associated milieu exists as a condition of functioning sin e q u a non , whereas it is an ensemble in the contrary case. Take a laboratory, such as a labora­
tory studying the physiology o f sensation. Is an audiometer a technical individual?
No, not if one considers it independently of the power supply and headphones
or speakers used as electro-acoustic transducers. The audiometer is defined, then,
by certain requisite conditions of temperature, voltage, and noise levels, so that
its frequencies and intensities may be sufficiently stable for the measurements of
thresholds. The rooms coefficient of absorption, its resonance at this or that fre­
quency must be taken into account; the room is part o f the complete apparatus:
for the audiometer to operate properly it requires either a flat and barren land­
scape, or that its measurements be made in an anechoic chamber, with a suspended
anti-microphonic floor and a thick layer of glass-wool on the walls. What then is
the audiometer in itself, such as it is sold by a manufacturer or such as one makes
oneself? It is an ensemble of technical forms, wherein each has a relative indi­
viduality; in general it has two high-frequency oscillators, where one is fixed and
the other variable; the lower of the two frequency beats serves to produce audible
sound; a fader facilitates the dosage of the intensity of the stimuli. Neither of these
oscillators constitutes a technical object in itself, because in order for it to be stable
the technical object requires the stabilized voltage of both heater and anode. This
stabilization is generally obtained through an electronic system with a recurrent
causality that functionally constitutes the associated milieu of the oscillators’ tech­
nical forms; this associated milieu, however, is not entirely an associated milieu; it
is, rather, a system of transfer, a means of adaptation enabling the oscillators not
to be conditioned by the natural and technical external milieu; this milieu would
become a truly associated milieu only if a random drift in frequency in one of the
oscillators were, as a consequence, to entail variation in the supply voltage oppos­
ing this frequency drift; there would be an exchange through reciprocal causality
between regulated supply and the oscillators; it is the ensemble of technical struc­
tures that would thereby be self-stabilized; here, on the contrary, only the supply
is self-stabilized and it does not react upon random variations in the frequency of
one of the oscillators.

64

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

There is a big theoretical and practical difference between these two cases; if
the supply is indeed simply stabilized without a recurrent causal link with the
oscillators, then simultaneous utilizations of this supply can be limited or extended
without inconvenience; it is then possible to plug a third oscillator into the same
supply without disturbing its functioning, provided the normal limits of output
are not exceeded; however, in order to obtain an efficient feedback regulation the
exact opposite is required: no more than a single structure can be attached to a
single associated milieu; otherwise opposed random variations in two structures
that are linked non-synergistically with the same milieu might compensate for one
another rather than resulting in a regulatory reaction; the structures attached to
the same associated milieu have to function synergistically. For this very reason the
audiometer comprises at least two distinct parts that cannot be stabilized by the
same associated milieu: the frequency generator on the one hand and the ampli­
fier-fader on the other. An action by one of these ensembles on the other must be
avoided, which notably leads to the careful separation of both their power supplies
and to electrically and magnetically shielding the partition that separates them,
in order to avoid any interaction. The material limit of the audiometer, however,
is not a functional limit; the amplifier-fader is normally extended by way of the
acoustic transducer and by the room or external ear of the subject, depending on
whether or not one employs speakers or headphones for coupling with the subject.
Henceforth, one can posit the existence of relative levels of individualization of
technical objects. This criterion has an axio lo gical value : the coherence of a technical
ensemble is at its maximum when this ensemble is constituted by sub-ensembles
with the same level of relative individualization. In a laboratory of physiology of
sensations there is thus no advantage in grouping the audiometers two oscillators
together with the amplifier-fader; however, it is worth grouping the two oscillators
together so that both are affected simultaneously and in equal proportion by any
variation in voltage or temperature, so that the variation of the lower frequency
of the beat, which will result from the two correlated variations of the frequency
of each of the oscillators, should be as low as possible, given that the two basic
frequencies will rise or fall at the same time. It would be perfectly contrary to the
functional unity of the beat-frequency generator, however, if two separate power
supplies were used and if one oscillator were plugged into one phase of the mains
and the other into another phase. One would thereby cancel the self-stabilizing
effect o f compensation between two variations, which gives the ensem ble of the
two oscillators its great stability in low beat frequencies. On the other hand, it
becomes useful to plug the oscillators into a mains phase different from the one

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

65

the amplifier-fader is plugged into, so as to avoid any reaction of variations in the
amplifiers anodic consumption of the oscillators’ power supply.
The principle of individualization of technical objects in an ensemble is thus one
of the sub-ensembles with recurrent causality in an associated milieu; all technical
objects having recurrent causality within their associated milieu must be separated
from one another and connected in such a way as to maintain the independence of
these associated milieus from one another. The sub-ensemble o f oscillators and that
of the amplifier-fader-transducer must therefore be more than simply independent
in terms of power supply, they must also be independent in terms of coupling to
each other: amplifier input should be of very high impedance in relation to the
oscillators’ output, so as to ensure that any reaction of the amplifier on the oscilla­
tors is very weak. If one were, for instance, to plug the fader directly into the outlet
of the oscillators, then the setting of this fader might react on the frequency of the
oscillators. An ensemble of a higher degree comprising all these sub-ensembles
is defined by the capacity to freely realize any form of relation, without thereby
destroying the autonomy of individualized sub-ensembles. This for instance is the
role of a general power switchboard and wiring-board in a laboratory; electrostatic
and electromagnetic shields, the use o f non-reactive coupling such as what we call
the cathode-follow er, aim at maintaining the independence of these sub-ensembles,
while also allowing for the diverse combinations among the functioning o f sub-en­
sembles that are necessary; such is the second degree of the functional role of the
ensemble that one can call a laboratory, namely the utilization of the results of
functioning without any interaction with the conditions of functioning.
We might ask then, on what level is the individuality found: at the level of
the sub-ensemble or at that of the ensemble? The answer lies, as always, in the
criterion of recurrent causality. At the level of the higher ensemble (such as that
of the laboratory) there is indeed no truly associated milieu; if it exists, then it
does so only in certain respects, and it is not a general milieu; the presence of
oscillators in the room where the experiment in audiometry takes place is often
problematic; if the oscillators use transformers with an iron magnetic circuit, then
the magnetostriction* of the iron plates creates a vibration, which in turn emits an
undesirable sound; an oscillator with resistances and capacities also emits a slight
sound due to alternative electrical attractions. For fine-tuned experiments it is nec­
essary to place the devices in another room and to operate them by remote control,
or to isolate the subject in an anechoic chamber. The same applies to the magnetic
radiation of power transformers, which can be very problematic in electro-encephalographic and electrocardiogiaphic experiments. A superior ensemble such as a

66

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

laboratory is thus above all constituted by un-coupling devices, in order to avoid
creating associated milieus by accident. The ensemble distinguishes itself from
technical individuals in the sense that the creation of a unique associated milieu is
undesirable; the ensemble is comprised of a certain number of devices in order to
counteract this possible creation of a unique associated milieu. It avoids internal
concretization of the technical objects it contains, and uses only the results of their
functioning, without allowing any interaction with their conditioning.
Are there other groupings with a certain individuality below the level of tech­
nical individuals? — Yes, but this individuality does not have the same structure
as that o f technical objects with an associated milieu; it is that of a plurifunctional
composition without a positive associated milieu, which is to say without self-reg­
ulation. Let us take the case of a hot-cathode lamp. When this lamp is inserted
into an assembly, with an automatically polarized cathode resistance, then it is
indeed the site of phenomena of self-regulation; for instance, if the heating voltage
increases, cathodic emission increases, as a result of which negative polarization
increases; the lamp s amplification hardly increases nor does its output or its anodic
dissipation augment much; a similar phenomenon enables class A amplifiers* to
automatically equalize output levels despite variations in the input level of the
amplifier. Such regulatory counter-reactions, however, do not uniquely reside
within the lamp alone; they depend on the whole of the assembly, and, in some
cases, within particular assemblies, they do not exist at all. A diode whose anode
heats up thus becomes a conductor in both directions, and this also increases the
intensity of the current going through it; the cathode receiving the electrons from
the anode heats up even more and emits more electrons: this destructive process
thus manifests a positive circular causality partaking in the whole assembly and not
only in the diode.
Infra-individual technical objects can be called technical elements; they dis­
tinguish themselves from true individuals in the sense that they do not have an
associated milieu; they can integrate into an individual; a hot-cathode lamp is a
technical element rather than a complete technical individual; it is comparable
to an organ in a living body. It would in this sense be possible to define a general
organology, studying technical objects at the level of the element, and which would
belong to technology, together with mechanology, which would study complete
technical individuals.

IV - Evolutionary succession a n d preservation
o f technicity. L aw o f relaxation

The evolution of technical elements can have repercussions for the evolution of
technical individuals; composed of elements and an associated milieu, technical
individuals depend to a certain extent on the characteristics of the elements they
implement. Electric magnetic motors can thus be much smaller today than in
Grammes days, because magnets have been greatly reduced in size. In certain
cases, elements are like the crystallization of a preceding technical operation that
produced them. In this sense, magnets with oriented grains, which we refer to as
magnetically tempered, are obtained through a procedure that consists in main­
taining a vigorous magnetic field around the molten mass that, once cooled, will
become the magnet; starting with the magnetization of the molten mass at a tem­
perature above the Curie point, its intense polarization is then maintained while
the mass cools; when the mass is cold, it constitutes a far more powerful magnet
than if it had been magnetized after cooling. Everything happens as if the vigorous
magnetic field produced an orientation of the molecules in the molten mass, an
orientation that maintains itself after cooling, if the magnetic field is sustained
during its cooling and transition into the solid state. Now, the furnace, the melting
pot, and the coils creating the magnetic field all together constitute a system that
is a technical ensemble; the heat of the furnace shouldn’t have an impact on the
coils, the induction field creating the heat in the molten mass shouldn’t neutralize
the continuous field aimed at bringing about the magnetization. This technical
ensemble is itself constituted of a certain number of technical individuals that are
organized in relation to each other, both in view of the result of their functioning
and so as to prevent the conditioning of each particular functioning from being
disturbed. In the evolution of technical objects we thus witness a passage of causal­
ity proceeding from prior ensembles to subsequent elements; such elements, once
introduced into an individual whose characteristics they modify, in turn enable
technical causality to rise from the level of the element to that of the individual,
then from the level of the individual to the level of the ensemble; here, in a new
cycle, technical causality once more descends to the level of the element via the
process of fabrication, where it reincarnates itself in new individuals and then in
new ensembles. There is thus a lineage of causality that is not rectilinear but ser­
rated, where one and the same reality exists first in the form of an element, then as
the characteristic of an individual and finally as the characteristic of an ensemble.

68

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

The historical solidarity that exists among technical realities is mediated by the
fabrication o f elements. For a technical reality to have posterity, it is not enough
for it simply to improve in itself: it must also reincarnate itself and participate in
this cyclical coming-into-being via a process of relaxation within the different levels
o f reality. The solidarity that exists among technical beings masks this other much
more essential solidarity that requires the temporal dimension of evolution, not
identical with biological evolution, however, which in turn is not characterized by
these successive changes of levels and which occurs along more continuous lines.
If transposed into biological terms, technical evolution would consist in the fact
that a species could produce an organ that would be given to an individual, which
would thereby become the first term of a specific lineage, which, in turn, would
produce a new organ. In the domain of life, an organ is not detachable from the
species; in the technical domain, an element is detachable from the whole that pro­
duced it, precisely because it is fabricated; and here, we see the difference between
the engendered and the produced. In addition to its spatial dimension, the technical
world has a historical dimension. Its current solidarity mustn’t mask the solidarity
o f succession; this latter solidarity is in fact what determines the great epochs of
technical life through a law o f serrated evolution.
Nowhere else does such a rhythm of relaxation find its equivalent; neither the
human nor the geographical world can produce such oscillations of relaxation,
with successive fits and spurts o f new structures. This relaxation time is the tech­
nical time properly speaking; it can become dominant with respect to all other
aspects o f historical time, to the extent that it can even synchronize other rhythms
of development and appear to determine the entire historical evolution, when in
fact it only synchronizes and brings about its phases. An example of this evolution
following a rhythm o f relaxation can be found in energy sources since the eigh­
teenth century. A large part of energy employed during the eighteenth century
came from waterfalls, displacements of atmospheric air and from animals. These
types of prime movers corresponded to artisanal exploitation or rather limited fac­
tories distributed along waterways. From these artisanal factories emerged the high
efficiency thermodynamic machines at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
and the modern locomotive, which is the result of the adaptation of Stephensons
valve gear to the multi-tubular boiler designed by Marc Seguin, lighter and smaller
than a French boiler. This valve gear allows for the variation of the relation between
admission time and expansion time, as well as for the ability to reverse gears (the
reversal of steam), through the intermediary of a neutral position. This artisanal
type of mechanical invention, which grants to the traction engine the capacity to

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

69

apply itself with ample variations of the engine torque to highly varied profiles,
at the cost of a loss of efficiency only in high power regimes (where the time of
admission is almost equal to the totality of the expansion stroke), makes thermal
energy easily adaptable to traction on rails. Stephenson’s valve gear and tubular
boiler, which are elements that emerge from the artisanal ensemble of the eigh­
teenth century, enter into the new individuals of the nineteenth century, especially
through the form of the locomotive. High tonnage transportation, which had now
become possible throughout all regions, and which was no longer constrained to
the contour lines and meandering of navigable tracks, led to the industrial concen­
tration of the nineteenth century, which not only incorporates individuals whose
functioning principle is based on thermodynamics, but is essentially thermody­
namic in its structures; it is therefore around coal sources of thermal energy and
close to the sites of the greatest deployment of thermal energy (coal mines and
iron works) that the great nineteenth-century industrial ensembles, at the peak
of their reign, are concentrated. We have gone from the thermodynamic element
to the thermodynamic individual and from the thermodynamic individual to the
thermodynamic ensemble.
The principal aspects of electrotechnics will in turn emerge as elements pro­
duced by these thermodynamic ensembles. Before acquiring their autonomy, the
applications of electrical energy emerge as highly flexible means for the transmis­
sion of energy from one place to another by way of energy transport cables. Metals
with high magnetic permeability are elements that are produced by way of the
application of thermodynamics to metallurgy. Copper cables and high resistance
porcelains for insulators emerge from steam-powered wire mills and coal furnaces.
The metallic frameworks of pylons as well as the cement for dams are both born
out of great thermodynamic concentrations and enter as elements into the new
technical individuals that the turbines and alternators are. A new wave and a new
constitution of beings become emphasized and concretized. In the production of
electrical energy Grammes machine gives way to the polyphase alternator; the
direct current of early energy transport gives way to alternative currents with con­
stant frequency, adapted to being produced by thermal turbine and consequently
also being produced by hydraulic turbine. These electrotechnic individuals have
integrated themselves into the ensembles of the production, distribution and utili­
zation of electric energy, whose structure differs vastly from that of thermodynamic
concentrations. The role played by the railway in this thermodynamic concentra­
tion is now replaced by the role played by high voltage transmission lines in the
ensemble of industrial electricity.

70

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

At the moment in which electrical technics reaches its full development, it pro­
duces new schemes in the form of elements that initiate a new phase: first, there
is particle acceleration, initially realized through electric fields and then through
continuous electric fields and alternative magnetic fields, which leads to the con­
struction of technical individuals, having enabled the discovery of the possibility
o f exploiting nuclear energy; subsequently, and quite remarkably, there is the pos­
sibility, afforded by electrical metallurgy, of extracting metals like silicon, which
allows the transformation o f the radiant energy of light into electrical current, with
an efficiency that already reaches a level relevant for limited applications (6%),
and which is not much lower than that of the first steam engines. A pure silicon
photo-cell, produced by large industrial electrotechnical ensembles, is the element
that hasn’t yet been incorporated into a technical individual; it is still only an
object of curiosity situated at the extreme end o f the technical possibilities of the
electro-metallurgic industry, but it is possible that it may become the point of
departure for a new phase o f development, analogous to the one we have experi­
enced with the development o f the production and utilization of industrial energy,
which itself is not yet complete.
Every phase o f relaxation is capable of synchronizing minor aspects or those of
almost equal importance; the development of thermodynamics thus went hand in
hand with railway transportation, not simply with the transportation of coal but of
passengers; on the contrary, the development of electrotechnics went hand in hand
with the development of automotive transport; the automobile, albeit thermody­
namic in principle, uses electric energy as an essential auxiliary, in particular for
ignition. Industrial decentralization, facilitated by long distance electrical energy
transfer, needs the automobile as a corresponding means for the transportation of
people to locations that are distant from each other and at different altitudes; corre­
sponding to the road rather than railway. The automobile and the high voltage line
are parallel technical structures that are synchronized, but not identical: electrical
energy cannot currently be applied to automobile traction.
Furthermore, there is no intrinsic relation between nuclear energy and energy
derived from the photoelectric effect; these two forms are nevertheless parallel,
and their developments are susceptible to mutual synchronization8; nuclear energy
will thus probably remain, for a long time to come, inapplicable to direct forms
of restricted utilization, such as those consuming a few dozen watts; photoelectric
energy, on the contrary, is a highly decentralizable energy; it is essentially decen­
tralized in its production, whereas nuclear energy is essentially centralized. The

V. - Technicity a n d evolution o f technics:
technicity as instrum ent o f technical evolution

The different aspects of the technical being's individualization constitute the center
of an evolution, which proceeds via successive stages, but which is not dialectical in
the proper sense of the term, because, in regard to it, negativity does not play the
role of an engine of progress. In the technical world negativity is a lack of individ­
uation, an incomplete junction of the natural world and the technical world; this
negativity is not the engine of progress; it is rather the engine of transformation,
it incites man to seek new, more satisfactory solutions than those he possesses.
This desire for change, however, does not happen directly within the technical
being; it happens within man as inventor and user; this change moreover must
not be confused with progress; a change that is too abrupt is contrary to technical
progress, because it prevents the transmission, in the form of technical elements, of
what an age has acquired to the one that follows.
For progress to exist, each age must be able to pass on to the next age the fruit
borne of its technical effort; what is capable of being passed on from one age to
another are neither technical ensembles, nor even individuals, but the elements
that these individuals, grouped as ensembles, were able to produce; thanks to their
capacity of internal inter-commutation, technical ensembles in fact have the pos­
sibility of going beyond themselves by producing elements that differ from their
own. Technical beings are different from living beings in many respects, but they
differ essentially in the following respects: a living being engenders beings that
are similar to itself, or that can become so after a certain number of successive
reorganizations occurring spontaneously if the required conditions obtain; a tech­
nical being, on the contrary, does not have this capacity; it cannot spontaneously
produce other technical beings similar to itself, despite the efforts of cyberneti­
cists who have tended to force technical beings to copy the living by constructing
beings that are similar to them: this possibility is currently a mere supposition
and is without foundation; but the technical being has greater freedom than the
living, afforded to it by its infinitely lesser degree of perfection; in these conditions
the technical being can produce elements that harbor the degree of perfection at

72

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

which the technical ensemble had arrived at, and which, in turn, can be reunited
to enable the construction o f new technical beings in the form of individuals; there
is thus no engendering here, no procession or direct production, but only indirect
production through the constitution of elements that contain a certain degree of
technical perfection.
This affirmation requires that we specify what the process of technical perfection
is. Empirically and externally one can say that technical perfection is a practical
quality, or at the very least the material and structural basis of certain practical
qualities; in this way a good tool is not simply one that is well put together and
well crafted. In practical terms an adze can be in poor condition, blunt, and yet not
be a bad tool; an adze is a good tool if, on the one hand, it has a curve suited for a
straight, well aimed strike at the wood, and, on the other hand, if it can be sharp­
ened and keep its sharpness even when employed to work on hard wood. This latter
quality in turn results from the technical ensemble employed to produce the tool.
It is because it is a fabricated element that the adze can be made of a metal whose
composition varies at different points; this tool is not only a hunk of metal shaped
into a certain form; it has been forged, which is to say that the molecular chains
of the metal have a certain orientation that varies in certain places, like a piece of
wood whose fibers are oriented in the direction that offers the greatest solidity and
elasticity, especially in the intermediary parts between the cutting edge and the flat
thick part which goes from the socket to the cutting edge; this region close to the
cutting edge deforms itself elastically during work, because it acts as both wedge
and lever on the piece of wood being chipped off. And finally, the cutting edge has
a higher steel content than the other parts; its steel needs to be hard, but in a proper
delimited way, for too much of hard steel in the cutting edge would make the tool
brittle and the edge would shatter into splinters. It is as if, in its totality, the tool
was made of a plurality of functionally different zones, welded together. The tool
is made not only of form and matter; it is made of elaborate technical elements
according to a certain schema of functioning and assembled into a stable structure
through the operation of fabrication. The tool unites within itself the results of
the functioning of a technical ensemble. In order to make a good adze a technical
ensemble of a foundry, forge, and quench hardening is required.
The technicity of the object is thus more than a quality of its use; it is that which,
within it, adds itself to a first determination given by the relation between form and
matter; it acts as an intermediary between form and matter, here for instance as the
progressive heterogeneity of the quench hardening in different points. Technicity
is the degree of the objects concretization. During the period of wood foundries, it

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

73

was this concretization that gave Toledo’s blades their value and prestige, and more
recently, led to the quality of Saint-Etienne s steel. These types of steel express the
result of the functioning of a technical ensemble comprising in equal measure the
qualities of coal used, as well as the temperature and chemical composition of the
soft water of the Furan river, or the species of green wood used to stir and refine the
molten metal prior to casting. In certain cases, technicity becomes predominant
with respect to the abstract aspects of the relation between matter and form. A coil
spring is thus a very simple thing in form and matter, yet the fabrication of springs
requires a high degree of perfection in the technical ensemble that produces them.
The quality of individuals, such as an engine or an amplifier, often depends much
more on the technicity of simple elements (valve springs, for instance, or a modu­
lation transformer) than on the ingenuity o f their assembly. Technical assemblies,
however, that are capable of producing certain simple elements, such as a spring or
a transformer, are sometimes extremely vast and complex, and almost coextensive
with all the ramifications o f several global industries. It would not be an exagger­
ation to say that the quality of a simple needle expresses the degree o f perfection
of a nations industry. This explains why there are judgments that are legitimate
enough in both practical and technical terms, such as when a needle is specifically
called an “English needle.” Such judgments have a practical sense, because techni­
cal ensembles express themselves in the simplest elements they produce. This mode
of thought of course exists for other reasons besides those that legitimate it, and
particularly because it is easier to qualify a technical object by its origin than to
judge its intrinsic value; what we have here is a phenomenon of opinion; but even
if this phenomenon gives rise to numerous exaggerations or intentional exploita­
tion, it is not without foundation.
Technicity can be considered a positive aspect of the element, analogous to
the self-regulation exerted by the associated milieu in the technical individual.
Concretization is technicity at the level of the element; it is the reason why the element is really an element produced by an ensemble, rather than being an ensemble
itself or an individual; this characteristic makes it detachable from the ensemble
and frees it so that new individuals may be constituted. There is of course no
peremptory reason why one would attribute technicity only to the element; the
associated milieu is the depositary of technicity at the level of the individual, just as extension is the depositary of inter-commutativity at the level of the ensemble;
it is nevertheless good to reserve the term technicity for this quality of the element, which expresses and preserves what has been acquired via a technical ensemble so as to be transported into a new period. What the element transports is a concretized 74 technical reality, whereas the individual and the ensemble contain this technical reality without being able to transport and transmit it; elements have a transduc­ tive property that makes them the true bearers of technicity, just as seeds transport the properties of a species and go on to make new individuals. It is thus within elements that technicity exists in the purest way, in a free state as it were, whereas in the individual or the ensemble, technicity only exists in a state of combination. However, this technicity, borne by the elements, contains no negativity, and no negative conditioning intervenes in the moment of production of elements by the ensembles or of individuals by invention, which reunites the elements in order to form individuals. Invention, which is a creation of the individual, presupposes in the inventor the intuitive knowledge of the element s technicity; invention occurs at this intermediate level between the concrete and the abstract, which is the level of schemas, and presupposes the pre-existence and coherence of representations that cover the objects technicity with symbols belonging to an imaginative sys­ tematic and an imaginative dynamic. The imagination is not simply the faculty of inventing or eliciting representations outside sensation; it is also the capacity of the prediction of qualities that are not practical in certain objects, that are neither directly sensorial nor entirely geometric, that relate neither to pure matter nor to pure form, but are at this intermediate level of schemas.
We can consider the technical imagination as being defined by a particular sen­
sitivity to the technicity of elements; it is this sensitivity to technicity, that enables
the discovery of possible assemblages; the inventor does not proceed ex nihilo,
starting from matter that he gives form to, but from elements that are already
technical, with respect to which an individual being is discovered as that which
is susceptible to incorporating them. The compatibility of elements in a technical
individual presupposes the associated milieu: the technical individual must there­
fore be imagined, which is to say presupposed as already being constructed in
the form of an ensemble of ordered technical schemas; the individual is a stable
system of the technicities of elements organized as an ensemble. What is organized
are these technicities, as well as the elements as basis of these technicities, not
the elements themselves taken in their materiality. An engine is an assemblage of
springs, axes, and volumetric systems, each defined by their characteristics and
their technicity, not by their materiality; thus, a relative indeterminacy can subsist in the localization of this or that element in relation to all the others. The location of certain elements is chosen more by virtue of extrinsic considerations than by intrinsic considerations of the technical object in relation to the diverse processes of its functioning. The intrinsic determinations, based on the technicity of each  75 element, are those which constitute the associated milieu. This associated milieu, in turn, is the concretization of the technicities contributed by all the elements, in their mutual reactions. Technicities can be thought of as stable behaviors, expressing the characteristics of elements, rather than as simple qualities: they are powers, in the fullest sense of the term, which is to say capacities for producing or under­ going an effect in a determinate manner.
The higher the technicity o f an element, the more the margin of indeterminacy
of this power diminishes. This is what we want to express when we say that the
elementary technical object concretizes itself as its technicity increases. One could
thus name this power a capacity, if one intends to characterize it in relation to a
determinate deployment. Generally, the higher the technicity o f an element, the
wider the conditions of deployment of this element are, as a result of the high level
of stability of this element. The technicity of a spring increases when it is capable
of bearing higher temperatures without losing its elasticity, when it preserves its
coefficient of elasticity without significant modification within larger thermal and
mechanical limits: it technically remains a spring but within a much larger frame­
work, and is suited to a less restricted incorporation into this or that technical
individual. An electrolytic condenser* has a lower degree of technicity than a dry
dielectric condenser, such as paper or mica. An electrolytic condenser in fact has
a capacitance that varies as a function of the voltage to which it is submitted; the
thermal limits of its utilization are more restricted. At the same time it varies when
submitted to constant voltage, because the electrolytes as well as the electrodes
become chemically altered during the course of their functioning. Dry dielectric
condensers, on the contrary, are more stable. Nevertheless, the technical quality
once again increases with the independence of its characteristics from the con­
ditions of utilization; a mica condenser is better than a paper condenser, and the
vacuum condenser is the best of all, since it is not even subject to the condition
that the voltage be limited lest the insulation risk perforation; an intermediary
degree, the ceramic silver-plated condenser for instance, which hardly varies with
temperature, and the air condenser, both provide a high degree of technicity. It
must be noted that in this sense there is not necessarily a correlation between the
commercial price of a technical object and its elementary technical quality. Very
often, considerations of price do not intervene in absolute terms, but via another
requirement, like that of space; an electrolytic condenser is thus preferred to a
dry dielectric condenser where its high capacity would require too much space to
house the condenser; similarly, an air condenser is often cumbersome with respect
to a vacuum condenser of the same capacitance; although it is much cheaper, and

76

is equally safe to deploy in a dry atmosphere. Therefore, in many cases, economic
considerations do not intervene directly, but through the repercussions that the
degree o f concretization of the technical object has on its deployment in an indi­
vidual ensemble. It is the general formula of the individual that is subjected to
economic repercussions, not that of the element as element. The liaison between
the technical and the economic domains occurs at the level of the individual or the
ensemble, but very rarely at the level of the element; in this sense, one could say
that technical value is largely independent of economic value and that it can be
appreciated according to independent criteria.
This transmission of technicity by its elements is what grounds the possibil­
ity of technical progress, above and beyond the apparent discontinuity of forms,
domains, the types o f deployed energy, and sometimes even beyond the schemas
of functioning. Each stage of development is the inheritor of previous ages, and its
progress is all the more certain as each stage tends increasingly and more perfectly
toward a state of sole beneficiary.
The technical object is not directly a historical object: it is subject to the course
of time only as a vehicle of technicity, according to a transductive role that it plays
with respect to a prior age. Neither the technical ensembles nor technical individ­
uals remain; only elements have the power to transmit technicity from one age
to another, in the form of an effectuated, accomplished, materialized result. For
this reason it is legitimate to analyze the technical object as consisting of technical individuals; but it is necessary to stress that at certain moments in its evolution the technical element makes sense in itself, and is thus a depositary of technicity.
In light of this, one can establish the foundation of the analysis of the technics of
a human group through the analysis of elements produced by its individuals and
its ensembles: often these elements alone have the power to survive the downfall
of a civilization, and remain valid witnesses of a state of technical development. In
this sense, the method of ethnologists is perfectly valid; but one could prolong its
application by equally analyzing the elements produced by industrial techniques.
Indeed, there is no fundamental difference between a people who have no indus­
try and those who have a well-developed industry. Even in a people without any
industrial development, technical individuals and technical ensembles exist; never­ theless, rather than being stabilized by institutions that fix and perpetuate them by
installing them, these individuals and ensembles are temporary or even occasional;
what is preserved from one technical operation to another are merely the elements,
which is to say tools or certain fabricated objects. To build a boat is an operation
that requires a truly technical ensemble: a fairly flat ground, yet close to the water,

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

77

sheltered yet luminous, with supports and wedges to keep the ship standing while
it is being built. The shipyard, like the technical ensemble, can be temporary: it is
no less a shipyard constituting an ensemble. Even today similar temporary techni­
cal ensembles still exist, sometimes even highly developed and complex ones, such
as the construction sites of buildings; others are provisional while being durable,
like mining facilities or the drilling rigs for oil exploration.
Not all technical ensembles necessarily take on the stable form of the factory or
the workshop. On the other hand it seems that non-industrial civilizations differ­
entiate themselves from ours mostly by the absence of technical individuals. This is
true only if what is meant is that technical individuals do not exist materially in a
stable and permanent way; the function of technical individualization, however, is
assumed by human individuals; the process of learning, through which man forms
habits, gestures, and schemas of action that enable him to use the highly varied
tools that the totality of an operation requires, pushes this man to individualize
himself technically; it is he who becomes the associated milieu of these diverse
tools; when he masters all of his tools, when he recognizes the moment he must
change tools in order to continue working or to use two or three tools at a time, he
ensures an internal distribution and self-regulation o f the task9 through his body.
In some cases, the integration in the ensemble of technical individuals happens via
the intermediary of an association of human individuals working in twos, in threes,
or in larger groups; when these groupings do not introduce functional differenti­
ation, then their only direct purpose is to increase the available energy or speed of
the work, but when differentiation is called for, they clearly demonstrate the gen­
esis of an ensemble on the basis of men employed as technical individuals rather
than as human individuals: this was the case with bow drilling, as described by the
authors of classical antiquity; it is still the case with the felling of certain trees; it
was also commonly the case, not so long ago, with the use of a two-man cross-cut
saw to make planks or rafters; two men working together in an alternating rhythm.
This explains why, in some cases, human individuality can be used functionally
as the basis of technical individuality; the existence of separate technical individ­
ualities is a rather recent development and even appears, in some respects, like an
imitation of man by the machine, where the machine remains the more general
form of a technical individual. Yet, in reality machines are very dissimilar to man,

9. This is where a certain nobility o f artisanal work comes from: man is the bearer of technicity, and work is the only mode of expression of this technicity. The imperative to work translates this requirement o f expression; to refuse to work when one possesses a technical knowledge that can only be expressed through work, because it cannot be formulated in intellectual terms, would be to hide one’s light under a bushel. The requirement o f expression, on the contrary, is no longer linked to work when technicity has become immanent to a knowledge that can be formulated abstractly and outside of all concrete actualization. 

78

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

and even when they function in a way that produces comparable results, it is very rare that they use procedures identical to the work of an individual man. The analogy is in fact most often very external. Yet if man often feels frustration before the machine, it is because the machine functionally replaces him as an individual: the machine replaces man as tool bearer. In the technical ensembles of industrial civilizations, jobs where several men must work in narrow synchronization are becoming rarer than in a past characterized by the artisanal level. Conversely, at
the artisanal level, it is very frequent that certain works require the grouping of
human individuals with complementary functions: to shoe a horse, one man is
needed to hold the hoof and another to hold the shoe up and nail it on. In order
to build, the mason has his assistant, the hod-carrier. In order to thresh with the
flail, one needs a proper perception of the rhythmical structures that synchronize
the alternate movements of the teams members. Yet one cannot affirm that what
has been replaced by machines are only the helpers; it is the very basis of technical
individualization that has changed: this basis was a human individual; it is now the
machine; tools are borne by the machine, and one could even define the machine
as that which bears and directs tools. Man directs and adjusts or regulates the
machine, the tool bearer; he realizes groupings of machines, but does not him­
self bear tools; indeed, the machine accomplishes the core work, the work of the
blacksmith and not that o f the helper; man, disengaged from this function of the
technical individual, which is the very essence of the artisanal function, can now
become either organizer o f the ensemble o f technical individuals, or helper of tech­
nical individuals: he greases, cleans, removes detritus and burrs, in other words, in
some respects he plays an auxiliary role; he provides the machine with elements,
changing the belt, sharpening the drill or the lathe cutting tool. There is thus, in
this sense, a role above that of the technical individuality, and one below it: servant
and regulator, he supervises the machine, the technical individual, by looking after
the relation of the machine with the elements and the ensemble; he is the organizer
of relations between technical levels, rather than being himself, like the craftsman,
one of the technical levels. A technician therefore adheres less to his professional
specialization than does a craftsman.
This nevertheless does not mean that man cannot be a technical individual in
any shape or form and work in conjunction with the machine; this machine-man
relation is realized when man applies his action to the natural world through the
machine; the machine is then a vehicle for action and information, in a relation with
three terms: man, machine, and world, the machine being that which is between
man and world. In this case, man preserves some traits of technicity defined in

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

79

particular by the necessity of apprenticeship. The machine thus essentially serves
the purpose of a relay, an amplifier of movements, but it is still man who preserves
within himself the center of this complex technical individual that is the reality
constituted by man and machine. One could say, in this case, that man is the bearer
of the machine, while the machine remains the tool bearer; this relation is thus par­
tially comparable to that of the machine-tool, if what is understood as machine-tool
is that which has no self-regulation. It is man who is at the center of the associated
milieu in this relation; the machine-tool is that which has no internal autonomous
regulation, and which requires man in order to make it work. Man intervenes here
as a living being; he uses his own sense of self-regulation in order to operate that of
the machine, even without the need for it to be consciously formulated: in order to
restart an overheating car engine a man will allow it to “rest,” and in order to start it back up, instead of beginning by revving it up too much, he will progressively
get it started from a cooler state. Such behaviors, which are technically justified,
have their correlation in vital regulations, and are lived by the driver more than
simply being thought by him. They apply all the better to the technical object as
the latter approaches the status of a concrete being, encompassing homeostatic reg­
ulations within its functioning. For the technical object that has become concrete,
there is indeed a regime in which the processes of self-destruction are reduced to
a minimum, because of the greatest possible degree of perfection in homeostatic
regulation. This is the case for the diesel engine, which requires a definite operating
temperature and a regime of rotation confined within a narrow margin between
minimum and maximum, while the gasoline engine is more flexible, because it
is less concrete. Similarly, an electronic tube cannot function with a cathode at
any temperature whatsoever or with an indeterminate anodic voltage; for power
tubes in particular, too low a cathode temperature causes the electric field to snatch
electron emitting oxide particles; hence the need for a gradual start up, beginning
with a warm up of the cathodes without anodic voltage, followed by the powering
of the anodes. If the circuits of polarization are automatic (fed by the cathodic cur­
rent), then they must be progressively powered through the gradual feeding of the
anodes; omitting this precaution leads to a short instant in which cathodic current
already occurs before polarization reaches its normal level (polarization produced
by this current and proportional to it tends to limit it): the cathodic output, which
is not yet limited by this negative reaction, would exceed the admissible maximum.
Speaking in very general terms, the precautions man takes for the preservation
of the technical object have as their goal the maintenance of its functioning or its
adjustment to conditions that prevent it from being self-destructive, which is to say

80

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

to conditions where it exercises a negative stabilizing reaction upon itself; beyond
certain limits, reactions become positive, and consequently destructive; this is the
case with an engine which, when over-heated, initiates galling and which, in heat­
ing up even more because o f the heat from the galling, subsequently deteriorates
irreversibly; an electronic tube whose anode becomes red hot, similarly loses its
asymmetrical conductivity, in particular within its rectifier function: it then enters
a phase of positive reaction. Allowing it the proper time to cool enables it to return
to its normal functioning.
Thus, man can intervene as a substitute for the technical individual, and connect
elements with ensembles, in an age when the construction of technical individuals
is not possible.
What one must take into account when thinking about the consequences of
technical development in relation to the evolution of human societies, is first
and foremost the process of the individualization of technical objects; human
individuality is increasingly disengaged from the technical function through the
construction o f technical individuals; for man, the functions that remain are both
below and above the role of tool bearer, oriented both toward the relation with
elements and toward the relation with ensembles. However, as it was precisely the
individuality of man that was once employed in technical work, and which had to
technicize itself because the machine couldn’t, it became customary to give each
human individual just one function in regard to work; this functional monism was
perfectly useful and necessary when man became a technical individual. But it now
creates unease, because man, who still seeks to be a technical individual, no longer
has a stable place alongside the machine: he becomes the servant of the machine
or the organizer of the technical ensemble; yet, in order for the human function
to make sense, it is necessary for every man employed with a technical task to
surround the machine both from above and from below, to have an understand­
ing of it in some way, and to look after its elements as well as its integration into
the functional ensemble. For it is a mistake to establish a hierarchical distinction
between the care given to elements and the care given to ensembles. Technicity
is not a reality that can be hierarchized; it exists as a whole inside its elements
and propagates transductively throughout the technical individual and ensembles:
through the individuals, ensembles are made of elements, and from them elements
issue forth. The apparent pre-eminence of ensembles comes from the fact that
ensembles are currently given the same prerogatives as those of people playing
the role of the boss. Yet ensembles are not in fact individuals; the devaluation of
elements equally results from the fact that the use of elements has hitherto been

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

81

proper to helpers and that these elements were not very elaborate. The unease of
this situation relating to man and machine thus comes from the fact that one o f the
technical roles, that of the individual, has thus far and until this day been played
by men; no longer a technical being, man is, henceforth obliged to learn a new
function and to find a place within the technical ensemble that no longer corre­
sponds to the technical individual; the first movement consists in occupying two
functions that are not individual, that of elements and that of the direction o f the
ensemble; yet in these two functions man finds himself to be in conflict with the
memory of himself: man has for so long played the role of the technical individual
that the machine, once it has become a technical individual, still appears like a man
occupying the place of another man, when it is, on the contrary, man who in fact
provisionally replaced the machine before truly technical individuals could emerge.
In all judgments made about the machine, there is an implicit humanization o f the
machine whose deepest source lies in this change of role; man had learned to be a
technical being to the point of believing that the technical being, once it becomes
a concrete being, begins illegitimately to usurp the role o f man. Ideas o f servitude
and liberation are far too strongly related to the old status of man as a technical
object for them to correspond to the true problem o f the relation between man
and machine. It is necessary, that the technical object be known in itself, in order
for the relation between man and machine to become stable and valid: hence the
necessity for a culture of technics.

We would like to show that the technical object can be connected with man in two
opposing ways: according to the status of majority or of minority. The status of
minority is one whereby the technical object is firstly an object of utility, necessary
for everyday life, belonging to the heart of the environment where the human
individuals growth and training takes place. In this case the encounter between the
technical object and man occurs essentially during childhood. Technical knowledge
is implicit, non-reflective, and habitual. Conversely, the status of majority corre­
sponds to an operation of reflection and self-awareness by the free adult, who has at
his disposal the means of rational knowledge, elaborated through the sciences: the
knowledge of the apprentice is thus distinguished from that of the engineer. Once
the apprentice has become an adult craftsman and the engineer has been integrated
into a network of social relations, they retain and project a vision of the technical
object that corresponds, in the first case, to the minority status and in the second
case to the majority status; what we have here are two very different sources of
representation and judgment related to the technical object. However, the crafts­
man and the engineer don’t merely live for themselves; they are both witnesses
to and agents of the relation between human society as a whole and the world of
technical objects, and they have an exemplary value: it is through them that the
technical object is incorporated into culture. To the present day, these two modes
of incorporation have not been capable of providing corroborating results, to the

104

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

extent that there is something akin to two different languages and types of thought
arising from technics that are incoherent with each other. This lack of coherence
is partly responsible for the contradictions of contemporary culture, to the extent
that it judges and represents the technical object in relation to man.
Moreover, this conflict between the majority aspect and the minority aspect is
only a particular case o f inadequacy that has always existed between the individual
or social man and technical reality. Throughout antiquity, a large part of technical
operations were excluded from the domain of thought: they were operations that
corresponded to servile occupations. Just as the slave was excluded from the city,
servile occupations and the technical objects corresponding to them were banned
from the universe of discourse, reflexive thought, and culture. Only the Sophists,
and to a certain extent Socrates, made the effort to introduce the technical opera­
tions practiced by slaves or freed men into the domain of noble thought. Majority
status was granted to only a few operations, such as agriculture, hunting, war and
the art of navigation. Technics that used tools were kept outside the domain of
culture (Cicero takes most o f his metaphors from the noble arts, in particular agri­
culture and navigation; the mechanical arts are rarely evoked by him).
Going further back in time one discovers that such or such a civilization also cre­
ated the distinction between noble technics and non-noble technics; the history of
the Jewish people reserves a privileged place for pastoral technics and considers the
land as cursed. God accepts the offerings of Abel, but not those of Cain: the pastor
is superior to the farmer. The Bible contains a multitude of schemas of thought
and paradigms drawn from various ways for helping to foster the flock. Conversely,
the Gospels introduce modes of thought taken from the experience of agriculture.
Perhaps one could find a certain technological bias at the origin o f mythologies and
religions, consecrating one technique as noble and not granting citizenship to the
others, even when they are used effectively; this initial choice between a major and
a minor technique, between a valued technique and a devalued technique, grants
an aspect of partiality, of non-universality to the culture that incorporates technical
schemas. Our research does not propose to ascertain the reasons and modalities of
this choice between fundamental techniques in each particular case, but simply to
show that human thought must establish an egalitarian relation, without privilege,
between technics and man. This task must still be accomplished, because these
phenomena of technical dominance — because of which there is, in each epoch,
a part of the technical world that is recognized by culture, while other parts of the
technical world are rejected — maintain an inadequate relation between human
reality and technical reality.

The disappearance of slavery in Western Europe allowed ancient servile tech­
niques to come to light and manifest themselves in clear thought: the Renaissance
recognized artisanal techniques by shedding the light of rationality onto them.
Rational mechanics introduced machines into the domain of mathematical
thought: Descartes calculated the transformations of movement within the simple
machines used by the slaves of antiquity. This effort toward rationalization, sig­
nifying an integration into culture, continued up until the end o f the eighteenth
century. Yet despite this, the unity of technics did not persist; a genuine reversal
took place, which repressed the ancient noble techniques (those of agriculture and
animal husbandry) into the domain of the irrational, the non-cultural; the relation
to the natural world was lost, and the technical object became an artificial object
distancing man from the world. We are only now beginning to see the possibil­
ity of an encounter between the way of thinking inspired by a technics related
to living beings and an artificialist way of thinking concerned with constructing
automata. Mechanical technics were only truly able to attain majority status by
becoming a technics thought by the engineer, rather than remaining the technics
of the craftsman; at the artisanal level, the concrete relation between the world
and the technical object still exists; but the object thought by the engineer is an
abstract technical object, unattached to the natural world. In order for culture to
incorporate technical objects, one would have to discover an intermediary between
the majority status and the minority status of technical objects. The condition
of the disjunction between culture and technics resides in the disjunction that
exists within the world of technics itself. In order to discover an adequate relation
between man and the technical object, one would have to be able to discover a
unity of the technical world, through a representation that would incorporate both
that of the craftsman and that of the engineer. The representation of the craftsman
is drowned in concreteness, engaged in material manipulation and sensible exis­
tence; it is dominated by its object; the representation of the engineer is one of
domination; it turns the object into a bundle of measured relations, a product, a
set of characteristics.
The prime condition for the incorporation of technical objects into culture
would thus be for man to be neither inferior nor superior to technical objects, but
rather that he would be capable of approaching and getting to know them through
entertaining a relation of equality with them, that is, a reciprocity of exchanges; a
social relation
fgs of sorts.

the conditions o f compatibility between one technology and another, such as that
of the Romans and that elaborated by the civilized societies of our day; perhaps
it will be possible to discover a real, if unapparent incompatibility between the
technological conditions of the nineteenth century and those of the mid-twenti­
eth century. Certain myths born from the inappropriate encounter between two
incompatible technological paradigmatisms could then be brought back to their
initial conditions and analyzed.
IL - Technics learn ed by the ch ild a n d technics thought by the ad u lt

One cannot study the status of the technical object in a civilization without taking
into account the difference between the relation of this object to the adult and the
child; even if life in modern societies has accustomed us to thinking that there is
continuity between the life o f the child and of the adult, the history of technical
education quickly shows that the distinction did exist, and that the characteristics of
the acquisition of technical knowledge are not the same depending on whether this
acquisition takes place in the adult or in the child; we have no intention whatsoever
of laying down a normative rule, but merely o f showing that the characteristics of
teaching technics have varied greatly throughout time, and that they have varied
not only due to the state o f technics, or the structure of societies, but also because
o f the age of the subjects who were learning; one could discover therein a circu­
lar relation of causality between the state of technics and the age of knowledge
acquisition constituting the technicians qualifications; if a very poorly rationalized
technics requires an extremely precocious initiation of learning, then the subject
will, even as an adult, retain a basic irrationality in his technical knowledge; he will
possess it by virtue of a very profound acquisition, due to his early habitual immer­
sion; as a result, the technicians knowledge will not consist of clearly represented
schemas, but o f a m an u al dexterity possessed almost by instinct, and entrusted to
this second nature that is habit. His science will be at the level of sensorial and
qualitative representations, very close to the concrete aspects of matter; this man
will be endowed with a power of intuition and complicity with the world that will
give him a very remarkable aptitude that can only manifest itself in work and not
in consciousness or discourse; the craftsman will be like a magician, and his knowl­
edge will be operational rather than intellectual; it will be an ability rather than a
knowing; by its very nature, it will be a secret for others, because it will be a secret
for himself, for his own consciousness.

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

To this day we find the existence of this technical subconsciousness, which
cannot be verbalized in clear terms by reflective activity, in farmers or shepherds,
capable of directly grasping the value of seeds, the exposure of a plot, the best place
to plant a tree or to set up a pasture so that it is sheltered and well positioned. These
men are experts in the etymological sense of the term: they take part in the living
nature of the thing they know, and their knowing is a one of profound, direct
participation that necessitates an original symbiosis, including a kind o f fraternity
with a valued and qualified aspect of the world.
Man here behaves like an animal who smells water or salt from a distance, who
immediately knows where to choose the place for a nest without prior reasoning.
Such participation is of an instinctive nature and it is only present when the life of
successive generations has made the rhythm of life, the conditions o f perception,
and the essential mental structures adapt to a kind of activity aimed at a stable
nature. In his remarkable tale titled The M in es o f F alu n , E. T. A. Hoffmann describes
a similar power of intuition in the miner; he feels danger and can find minerals in
the most hidden veins; he lives in a kind of co-natural relation with underground
nature, and this co-naturalness is so profound that it excludes all other feeling or
attachment; the true miner is a subterranean man; the one who descends into the
mine without loving it won’t discover this essential co-naturalness, as is the case
with the errant sailor who bravely signs up to work in the mine because he loves
a young girl; he becomes the mine’s victim, on the very morning of his wedding.
There is no morality here; the young sailor is full of merit and virtue. But he is a
sailor, and not a miner; he doesn’t have the intuition of the mine. The phantom
of the old miner warns him of the danger he is in, because the mine rejects the
intruder, as one who comes from outside, from another trade, from another life,
and who is not endowed with the power of participation. In the farmer, the shep­
herd, the miner, and the sailor, human nature doubles as a second nature which is
like an ancestral pact with an element or a region. It is difficult to say whether this
sense of participation is acquired in the first years of life or whether it is involved in
a hereditary patrimony; what remains certain is that this kind of technical training
[form ation ], consisting of intuitions and purely concrete operative schemas that are
very difficult to formulate or transmit through any kind of symbolism, be it oral or
figurative, belongs to childhood. For this same reason it is unlikely to evolve, and
can hardly be re-formed in adulthood: it is not, in fact, of a conceptual or scientific
nature, and cannot be modified through oral or written symbolism.

108

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

This technical training is rigid. It would be entirely wrong to consider this
technical training as necessarily inferior to a training using intellectual symbols;
the quantity o f information of this type of instinctive training can be as great
as that contained within knowledge clearly explained through symbols, graphs,
schemas, or formulas; it is too easy to oppose routine to science, which would by
the same token be progress; primitiveness cannot be confused with stupidity, any
more than conceptualization with science. But it is worth noting that this technical
knowledge is effectively rigid, since man cannot become a child again in order
to acquire new basic intuitions. Furthermore, this form of technics has a second
characteristic: this characteristic is one of initiation and it is exclusive; it is indeed
by growing up in a community that is already fully saturated with the schemas of a
particular work that the child acquires base intuitions; the one who comes from the
outside will more than likely be deprived of this initial participation that requires
the existence of vital conditions, because the vital conditions are educational in
this primary sense. It would, without a doubt, be wrong to attribute the closure of
ancient technics to the closure o f the communitarian life of societies: such societies
in fact knew how to open themselves up, as the temporary or seasonal migration of
farmers from Auvergne to Paris toward the end of the nineteenth century shows;
it is technics itself that corresponds in this case to a closed regime of life, because
technical training is valid only for the society that formed it, and is therefore the
only one valid for that society. It seems that historians are inclined to consider the
rites o f initiation of ancient trades in a rather abstract manner, by looking at them
from a purely sociological point of view; it is worth noting that these are tests that
correspond to a regime o f acquisition of technical knowledge by the child; the
test is thus not only a social rite, but also an act through which the young subject
becomes an adult by taming the world, by measuring himself with it in a critical
circumstance and by triumphing. There is a certain magic in this test, which is an
act through which the child becomes a man, by using all his strength pushed to
its extreme limit for the first time. If he weakens or shows himself to be inferior in
this dangerous confrontation with the world and with matter, he risks foregoing
the effectiveness of his manly action. If a hostile nature cannot be defeated, the
man cannot become a complete adult, because a gap has arisen between nature and
himself; the test is a life-long enchantment of the technical being; it is an operation
that creates the obedience of matter to man, who has become its master because
he succeeded in taming it, like an animal that becomes docile from the day it first
allowed itself to be led. If the first gesture is a mishap, the animal rebels and remains
wild; it will never again accept this master, who will, himself, forever be lacking

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

109

in self-assurance, because the immediate contact has been broken. In this test, a
law of all or nothing manifests itself; man and the world are therein transformed;
an asymmetrical union is constituted; one must not say that the test is a demon­
stration of courage or ability as if it were simply an exam; it creates these qualities,
because courage is made by way of an immediate and certain connection with the
world, which wards off all uncertainty and all hesitation; courage is not a defeated
fear, but a fear always warded off by the presence of an intuition because of which
the world is with the one who acts; the skillful man is the one whom the world
accepts, whom matter loves and obeys with the faithful docility of an animal who
has recognized his master. Skill is one o f the forms of power, and power supposes
an enchantment making an exchange o f forces possible, or rather a more primi­
tive and more natural mode of participation than that of enchantment, which is
already very elaborate and partially abstract. In this sense, skill is not the exercise
of a violent despotism, but of a force conforming to the being who conducts it.
There is, in the true power of the skillful man, a relation o f recurrent causality. The
true technician loves the matter upon which he acts; he is on its side, he is initiated
but respects that to which he is initiated; he forms a couple with this matter, after
having tamed it, and only delivers it with caution to the profane, because he has
a sense of the sacred. The craftsman and the farmer to this day still experience an
aversion to consigning some works or products to commerce that express their
most refined and most perfect technical activity: this prohibition of commerciality,
of divulgation, can be seen in the not-for-sale prints of a book that a printer, editor,
or author can distribute. It can also be seen in the Pyrenean farmer who offers his
visitor a certain food in his home, which can neither be bought nor taken away.
The secret and stable aspect of such a technics is thus not only a product of
social conditions; it produces the structure of groups as much as this structure of
the group conditions it. It is possible that every technics must to a certain extent
contain a coefficient of intuition and instinct necessary for establishing the appro­
priate communication between man and the technical being. But besides this first
aspect of technical formation, there exists a second aspect that stands in an inverse
relation to the first, and which is essentially aimed at the adult. As in the preceding
case, there is a dynamic action exerted on the individual man and on the group,
leading him to possess an adult mentality.
This second type of technical knowledge is a rational, theoretical, scientific, and
universal knowledge. The best example is Diderot and d’Alembert's Encyclopedia.
If the Encyclopedia appeared as a powerful and dangerous work, then it was not
because of its veiled or direct attacks on a certain abuse of privilege, nor because

110

o f the “philosophical” aspect of certain articles; there were more violent libels and
pamphlets than the Encyclopedia. The Encyclopedia was respectfully feared because
it was moved by an enormous force, that of a technical encyclopedist^ a force
that had brought together powerful and enlightened protectors; this force existed
by itself, because it responded to the needs of its time, more than political or
financial reforms did; it was this force that was positive and creative, and which
realized an equally remarkable assembly o f researchers, editors, and correspondents
by granting a faith to this team composed o f men who collaborated without being
connected through social or religious communities; a great work had to be carried
out. The greatness o f the Encyclopedia , its novelty, resides in the fact that its prints
o f schemas and models o f machines, which are an homage to the trades and to the
rational knowledge o f technical operations, are fundamentally major. But these
prints do not have the role of pure, disinterested documentation for a public eager
to satisfy its curiosity; the information in them is complete enough to constitute a
useable practical documentation, such that anyone who owns the book would be
capable o f building the described machine or of further advancing the state reached
by technics in that domain through an invention, and to begin his research where
that o f others who preceded him leaves off.
The method and structure o f this new way o f teaching stands in an inverse rela­
tion to the preceding one: it is rational and doubly universal; this is why it is adult.
It is rational because it employs measurement, calculation, procedures of geomet­
rical figuration and descriptive analysis; it is also rational because it calls upon
objective explanations and invokes experimental results, with the aim of a precise
presentation o f conditions, treating as a hypothesis whatever is conjectural and as
established fact whatever one must consider as such; not only is scientific explana­
tion required, but it is required with a clear taste for the scientific spirit. Moreover,
this way o f teaching is doubly universal, both through the public it addresses and
through the information it provides. O f course, what is taught here is high-level
knowledge, but despite this, it is meant for all; the cost of the book alone limits
the possible purchases. This knowledge is given in the spirit of the highest possible
universality, according to a circular schema that never supposes that a technical
operation is closed in on itself through the secret of its specialty, but rather that
it is related to other operations, using analogous types of apparatuses, and based
upon a small number of principles. For the first time, one sees a technical universe
constituting itself, a cosmos wherein everything is related to everything else rather
than being jealously guarded by a guild. This consistent and objective universality,
which supposes an internal resonance of this technical world, requires that the

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

111

book be open to all and that it constitute a material and intellectual universality, a
block of available and open technical knowledge. This teaching supposes an adult
subject, capable of directing himself and of discovering by himself his own normativity without being directed by another being: the autodidact is necessarily an
adult. A society of autodidacts cannot accept tutelage and the status of spiritual
minority. It aspires to govern itself on its own, and to manage itself. It is principally
in this sense and through its technological power that the Encyclopedia brought
about a new force and a new social dynamic. The causal circularity of encyclopedic
knowledge excludes the moral and political heteronomy of the monarchy [l'A ncien
Régim e]. The technical world discovers its independence when it realizes its unity;
the Encyclopedia is a kind of Fête de la Fédération1 of technics discovering their
solidarity for the first time.

The signification o f encyclopedism

We shall attempt to analyze the relation between the encyclopedic spirit and the
technical object, because it appears indeed to be one of the poles of all technical
awareness, and thus possesses, in addition to its historical signification, a sense
of the knowledge of technicity that is still valid. We have opposed the implicit,
instinctive, and magical aspect of technical education aimed at the child to the
inverse aspects of the latter, which one discovers in the Encyclopedia ; but this oppo­
sition runs the risk of masking a deep analogy of the dynamisms inherent in these
structurations of technical knowledge; encyclopedism manifests and propagates
a certain inversion of technics’ fundamental dynamisms; this inversion is never­
theless possible only because operations are not annihilated, but displaced and in
a way turned around. The Encyclopedia also manipulates and transfers forces and
powers; it too performs an enchantment and draws a circle like the magic circle;
except that it does not enchant by the same means as those inherent in the testing
of instinctive knowledge, and it is not the same reality that it places within the
circle of knowledge. It is human society with its forces and obscure powers that
is placed within the circle, having become immense and capable of comprising
everything. This circle is represented and constituted by the objective reality of V

basis of new, rational principles. [TN]

the book. Everything that is represented in the encyclopedic book is at the service
o f the individual who has in his possession a figurai symbol of all human activi­
ties in their most secret details. The Encyclopedia makes initiation universal, and
thereby produces a sort of rupture in the very sense of initiation; the secret of the
objectified universal maintains a positive sense of the notion of the secret (the
perfection of knowledge, a familiarity with the sacred), but annihilates the negative
aspect (obscurity, a means o f exclusion through mystery, knowledge reserved to a
small number o f men). Technics becomes an exoteric mystery.23The Encyclopedia
is a magic cipher [v o u ltf and is all the more efficient as it has been built with a
more precise, more exact and more objective representation of its model; all the
active resources, all the living forces o f human operations are assembled in this
object-symbol. Each individual capable o f reading and of understanding possesses
the voult o f the world and of society. Magically, everyone is master of everything,
because he possesses the voult o f the whole. The cosmos, once enveloping and supe­
rior to the individual, and the social circle constraining and always eccentric with
respect to the power of the individual, are now in the hands of the individual, like
the globe representing the world which the emperors carry as a sign of sovereignty.
The power, the confidence o f the reader of the encyclopedia is the same as that of
a man who first attacked the effigy of an animal before confronting it in nature,
the same once again as that of the primitive farmer who entrusted the seeds to the
soil after having performed propitiatory rites, or of the voyager who ventured to
new places only after having rendered them in some way favorable through an act
o f establishing communion and pre-possession of which the Odyssey preserves a
memory.4 The gesture of initiation is a union with a reality that remains hostile so
long as it hasn’t been tamed and possessed. It is for this reason that all initiation
leads to virility and adulthood. Thus from a psycho-sociological point of view,
every manifestation of the encyclopedic spirit can appear, within a society, as a fun­
damental movement [m ouvem ent de fo n d ] expressing the need for attaining a state
of freedom and adulthood, since the current regime or customs of thought retain
individuals within a state of tutelage and artificial minority; this will to move from
minority to majority by way of enlarging the circle of knowledge and liberating
the power inherent in knowing, is what we encounter on three occasions in the

history of thought since the Middle Ages. Hie first manifestation of encyclopedic
spirit is what constitutes the Renaissance and is contemporary with the ethical
and religious revolution of the Reformation. To want to move from the Vulgate to
the veritable text of the Bible, looking for the Greek texts rather than contenting
oneself with poor Latin translations, rediscovering Plato beyond a scholastic tradi­
tion crystallized according to a fixed dogma, is to refuse the arbitrary limitation of
thought and of knowledge. Erudition represents not a return to the past as past,
but the will to enlarge the circle of knowledge, to rediscover all of human thought
in order to be freed from a limitation of knowledge.
The humanism of the Renaissance is not at all a will to redeploy a fixed image
of man in order to restrain and normalize knowledge, as the decay into which the
study of classical antiquity has fallen would appear to suggest today. Humanism
first of all responds to an encyclopedic movement [élan ]. But this movement is
always oriented toward already formalized knowledge because the level of technical
development was not sufficiently advanced so as to allow a rapid formalization
of this domain to intervene; The sciences in particular were too underdeveloped;
the intellectual means of universalizing technics were not ready; it is the seven­
teenth century that brought about the means for universalizing technics which the
Encyclopedia then put to work; nevertheless, we should note the very positive atti­
tude toward technics from the Renaissance onward; already with the Renaissance,
technics are valued as a paradigm and means of expression,5 or for their human
value which opens new paths. Rabelais’s magnificent praise of the Pantagruelion
plant6 summarizes all the hopes of the men of the Renaissance, all their beliefs
in the “virtue” of technics, thanks to which humanity would perhaps one day be
capable of traveling all the way “up to the celestial signs,” in the same way that
humanity had travelled from the Old World to the New World.
The second encyclopedic stage is that of the Enlightenment; scientific thought
was freed, but technical thought did not find liberation; it is scientific thought that
freed technical thought. Since technics touch upon commerce, agriculture, and
industry, and these are aspects of society, this technological encyclopedism could
not help but be correlated with social and administrative reforms. Institutions

such as the elite schools [ G ran d es É co les] emerge from this encyclopedism;
encyclopedism is by definition polytechnic in its industrial form, just as it is physiocratic in its agricultural form. The industrial aspect becomes more developed
than the physiocratic aspect, because encyclopedic rationalization facilitated more
pronounced transformations in the industrial domain, benefiting from the recent
scientific discoveries of the late eighteenth century. This asymmetrical development,
however, should not make us forget that one of the most important components
of the technical encyclopedic spirit is the direct link between the individual with
the vegetal and animal world, with biological nature; rather than leaving it to the
descendants of former serfs, the art of plowing is valued even by the most distin­
guished figures. This is the “pastoral” era, and a time where a mind as solid as that
of Daubenton sees no shame in writing a treatise for shepherds which is the proto­
type of generous, high level popularization, unifying the old tradition of didactic
works and giving it a new lease on life through the use of a clear graphic symbolism
that is almost comprehensible enough for the illiterate; the substance of this beau­
tiful book resides in its etchings, as neat and expressive as those of the Encyclopedia.
It must indeed be noted that technology calls for a means of expression other
than oral expression, which uses already known concepts, and which can transmit
emotions, but struggles to express schemas of movement or precise material struc­
tures; a symbolism adequate for technical operation is visual symbolism, with its
rich play of forms and proportions. The civilization of the word gives way to that
of the image. The civilization of the word, in turn, is by its very nature even more
exclusive than that of the image, because the image is by nature universal, requiring
no prior code of significations. All verbal expression tends to become initiatory; it
becomes specialized by becoming a kind of ciphered language, of which the old
jargon of the guilds is a clear example. One has to belong to a closed group in order
to understand the oral or written language; to understand schematic expression,
it is enough to be able to perceive. It is with the schema that technical encyclope­
dism takes on all its meaning [sens]7 and its power of diffusion, by becoming truly
universal. The printing press had given rise to a first phase of encyclopedism by
distributing texts; but this encyclopedism could only reach reflexive or emotive sig­
nifications, already sanctioned by the constituted culture; with the printed word as
intermediary, the information going from individual to individual makes a detour
through the social institution that is language. Through the mediation of the visual
sign, printed writing first transmits an oral message, with all the limitations inher­
ent in this mode of expression; to be in possession of all the modern and all the
7.

“Sens” in French signifies both “meaning” and “direction toward which,” as well as “sense.” [TN]

dead languages is necessary for the understanding of an encyclopedism o f verbal
significations; this possession, or at least the effort going toward this possession, is
in part the meaning [sens] of the Renaissance, but in fact it remains the privilege
of humanists and scholars; culture does not have any direct universality through
oral or written language. It is perhaps for this reason that the Renaissance was
unable to establish a technological universality, even though it had a tendency to
prefer sculptural and graphic expression to all other symbolism, especially in the
arts. Printing, which is a faculty for the diffusion of a spatial schema, acquires its
full sense in etchings. Yet, symbolic etching, used as a means for clearly translating
a thought into the terms of structures and operations, freed o f any intention in
the direction of allegorical expression returning to oral expression (as on a coat of
arms), appears with its complete development in the seventeenth century, as for
instance in Descartes’s treatises. Having borrowed its expressive force and its power
of precision from the common use of geometry, it was now ready to constitute the
adequate symbolism of a universal technology.
A third stage of encyclopedic thinking finally appears to announce itself in our
own era, but hasn’t yet succeeded in constituting its modes o f universal expression.
The civilization of oral symbolism has once more overcome that of spatial, visual
symbolism, because the new means of diffusion of information have given primacy
to oral expression. When information must be converted into a printed object
and transported, the delay separating the discovered thought from the expressed
thought is the same for written information as it is for figurai information. Printing
tends to privilege figurai information, because it necessarily uses the spatial form;
the schema is that which does not require translation into a form other than its
original form, whereas writing is the translation of a series that is temporal in its
origin into a spatial series, which will have to be converted back into a temporal
series upon reading it. On the contrary, in the case of information transmitted by
telephone, telegraph or radio waves, the means of transmission requires the trans­
lation of a spatial schema into a temporal series, and subsequently its conversion
back into a spatial schema; radio diffusion in particular is directly suited to oral
expression, and may be adapted to the transmission of a spatial schema only with
great difficulty; it consecrates the primacy of sound. Spatial information is thus
relegated to the domain of expensive or rare things, always late with respect to oral
information, which is valued because it follows every step of vital8 coming-intobeing. A civilization, however, is guided by a latent paradigmatism at the level of
the information it values; this paradigmatism has once again become oral; thinking

once again takes place according to verbal semantemes, of the order of the slogan.
The acting presence of inter-human relations is of the order of the verb. There
is of course cinema and also television. But we must note that, due to the very
dynamism of its images, cinematography is a cinematic, dramatic action, rather
than a graphics of simultaneity, and not a direct expression of the intelligible and
stable form; subsequent in its discovery to the first attempts at the transmission
of images by television, cinematography has completely supplanted the latter and
has imposed on it the dynamism of images, which still burdens television with
an enormous task, and turns it into a competitor or imitator of cinematography,
incapable of discovering its own modes of expression, enslaved to the public as a
means of pleasure. Cinematographic movement is rich in hypnosis and rhythm
that dulls the reflexive faculties o f the individual in order to induce a state of aes­
thetic participation. Organized according to a temporal series that employs visual
terms, cinema is an art and a means of expressing emotions; the image here is
a word or a phrase, it is not an object comprising a structure to be analyzed by
the activity of the individual being; it rarely becomes an immobile and radiating
symbol. Furthermore, television could become a means of information contempo­
rary to human activity, which cinema cannot be, since, being a fixed and recorded
thing, it puts everything it incorporates into the past. But since television wants
to be dynamic, it is obliged to transform every point of each image into a tempo­
ral series, in as short a time as the projection of each static image in the cinema.
Therefore, it must first of all transform the dynamic into the static, through a first
cut into images. Then, during the transmission of each fixed image, it transforms
the simultaneous points of this fixed image into a temporal series; upon its arrival,
each temporal series transforms itself into a spatial and immobile picture, and the
rapid succession of these fixed images, as in cinematography, recreates the ana­
lyzed movement, according to the characteristics of the perception of movement.
This double transformation consequently results in the necessity of transmitting
an enormous quantity of information, even for an image that is extremely simple
in its intelligible structure. There is no common measure between the quantity
of information that is effectively interesting and significant for the subject, and
the quantity of information that is technically employed, corresponding to several
million signals per second. This waste of information hinders television from being
a subtle and faithful means of expression for the individual, and prevents a veri­
table visual symbolism from constituting itself universally; radio broadcasts cross
boundaries whereas visual information often remains tied to the communitarian
life of groups; it cannot be valued in these conditions. But research into coding

systems, useful for inscribing the results of calculating machines on a cathode ray
oscilloscope screen, or for displaying signals o f electromagnetic910detection on the
same type of screen, appear capable of conveying a very great simplification of the
Hertzian transmission of schematic images; visual information would thus regain
the place that it has lost because o f radio broadcasts with respect to spoken lan­
guage and would be capable of giving rise to a new universal symbolism.
The encyclopedic intention, in turn, begins to show itself within the sciences
and technics, through the tendency toward rationalization o f the machine and
through the establishment of a symbolism common to the machine and to man;
it is because of this symbolism that a synergy between man and machine is pos­
sible; for common action requires a means of communication. And since man
cannot have several types of thought (every translation corresponds to a loss of
information), it is this mix of the relation between man and machine that a new
universal symbolism must emulate in order to be homogeneous with a universal
encyclopedism.
Cybernetic thinking has already led in information theory to research such
as that into hum an engineering™ which specifically studies the relation between
man and machine; one can henceforth conceive of an encyclopedism on a techno­
logical basis.
This new encyclopedism must, like the two preceding ones, bring about a libera­
tion, but in a different sense; it cannot be a repetition o f the Enlightenment. In the
sixteenth century man was enslaved to intellectual stereotypes; in the eighteenth
century, he was limited by the hierarchical aspects of social rigidity; in the twen­
tieth century, he is enslaved to his dependence on unknown and distant powers
that direct him while he can neither know nor react against them; it is isolation
that enslaves him, and the lack of homogeneity of information that alienates him.
Having become a machine in a mechanized world,11 he can regain his freedom only
by taking on this role and by superseding it through an understanding o f technical
functions thought from the point of view of their universality. Every encyclope­
dism is a humanism, if by humanism one means the will to return the status of
freedom to what has been alienated in man, so that nothing human should be
foreign to man; however, this rediscovery can take place in different ways, and910

11. Today man follows a strong tendency that drives him to behave like a tool-bearing machine, because for many centuries
prior to the creation o f machines he fulfilled this function, at a time when technical elements existed, in the form o f tools,
and technical ensembles existed in the form o f workshops or building sites, but not as technical individuals in the form o f
machines.

each age recreates a humanism that is to a certain extent always appropriate to its
circumstances, because it takes aim at the most severe aspect of alienation that a
civilization contains or produces.
The Renaissance defined a humanism capable of compensating for the alien­
ation resulting from ethical and intellectual dogmatism; it aimed at regaining
the freedom of theoretical intellectual thought; the eighteenth century wanted to
rediscover the signification of the effort of human thought applied to technics,
and with the idea of progress, rediscovered the nobility of creative continuity that
can be found in inventions; it has defined the right of a technical initiative to exist
despite the inhibiting forces of societies. The twentieth century seeks a humanism
capable of compensating for the form of alienation that intervenes within the very
development of technics, through a series of specializations that society demands
and produces. There appears to be a singular law of the transformation [devenir]
of human thought, according to which any ethical, technical, and scientific inven­
tion, which sets out as a means of liberation and rediscovery of man, becomes
through its historical evolution an instrument that turns against its liberation and
enslaves man by limiting him: at its origin Christianity was a liberating force, call­
ing on man to go beyond the formalism of customs and the institutional prestige
of ancient society.
It was the thought according to which the Sabbath is made for man, and not
man for the Sabbath; it is this same Christianity, however, which the reformers of
the Renaissance accused of being a force of rigidity, tied to a constraining formal­
ism and dogmatism, contrary to the real and profound sense of human life. The
Renaissance opposed Physis to Antiphysis. Similarly, technics, invoked as a libera­
tion through progress during the Enlightenment, are today accused of oppressing
man and of reducing him to slavery by denaturing him, of estranging him from
himself through a specialization that is a barrier and source of incomprehension.
The center of convergence has become a principle of partitioning. This is why
humanism can never be a doctrine or even an attitude capable of being defined
once and for all; each epoch must discover its humanism, by orienting itself toward
the main danger of alienation. During the Renaissance, the rigidity of dogma led
to the emergence of a new fervor and a new movement [élan ].
In the eighteenth century, the infinite fragmentation of social hierarchy and
closed communities pushed toward the discovery of a means of universal and
unmediated efficacy, overcoming, by way of the rationalization and universalization
of the technical gesture, all barriers and prohibitions that custom had established.
In the twentieth century, it is no longer the hierarchical or local fragmentation of

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

119

society that creates the alienation of human society with respect to man, but rather
its vertiginous, unlimited and moving immensity; the human world o f technical
action has once again become a stranger to the individual through its develop­
ment and formalization, hardening itself into a form of machinism that has now
become a new attachment of the individual to an industrial world that exceeds the
dimension and possibility of thinking the individual. The liberating technics o f the
eighteenth century is at a human scale because it is of the artisanal type. The tech­
nics of the twentieth century is beyond the forces of the individual, and constitutes
a compact and resistant, but alienated human reality within the industrial world,
completely beyond the grasp of the individual just as it was for the previously
hierarchized society.
Man no longer needs a universalizing liberation, but a mediation. The new
magic will not be found in a direct expression o f the individual power to act,
assured by the knowledge that gives each gesture effective certainty, but in the
rationalization of forces that situate man by giving him meaning within a human
and natural ensemble. The very fact that teleology is treated as a knowable mech­
anism that is not definitively mysterious is indicative of the attempt not to accept
a situation as one simply lives it and is subjected to it. Rather than seeking the
procedure for the fabrication of objects without making a pact with matter, man
frees himself from his situation of being enslaved by the finality of the whole, by
learning how to create finality, by learning how to organize a finalized whole that
he judges and appreciates, so as not to have to be passively subjected to a de fa c to
integration. Cybernetics, being a theory of information and as a consequence also
a theory of finalized structures and dynamisms, frees man from the constraining
closure of organization by enabling him to judge this organization, rather than
being subjected to it while venerating and respecting it because he is not capable
of thinking or constituting it.12 Man overcomes enslavement by consciously orga­
nizing finality, just as he dominated the unfortunate necessity of work during the
eighteenth century by rationalizing it so as to render work efficient rather than
suffering through it in resignation. Human society, in knowing its own teleological
mechanisms, is the result of conscious human thought, and consequently incorpo­
rates those who create it; it is the product of a human effort of organization, and
12. In past centuries, an important cause of alienation lay in the fact that the human being lent his biological individuality
to technical organization: he was bearer o f tools; technical ensembles could establish themselves only by incorporating man
as tool bearer. The deforming aspect o f the profession was at once psychic and somatic. The tool bearer was deformed by the
usage of tools. Professional somatic deformations have become rare in the present day. In the repugnance felt by the gentle­
man [l ’honnête homme] toward men of the trade, there is perhaps a part o f the unpleasant feeling that one has when seeing
a monstrosity. Todays occupational hazards are minimal with respect to professional deformations of the past. For Plato the
pâvauooç [banausus] is a bald dwarf. In the sung legend, the shoemaker is a disinherited creature.

creates an adequation between the fact of being situated and the fact of situating
oneself. The place man has in a society thereby becomes a relation between an
element of activity and an element of passivity, as a mixed status always liable
to being taken up again and improved, because it is something human that is
interrupted but not alienated. Consciousness is at once a demiurgic activity and
the result of a preceding organization; social reality is contemporary with human
effort and homogeneous with it. Only a schema of simultaneity, a constellation
of forces represented in their relational power, can be adequate for this type of
reality. Its development is what such a dynamic representation of man in society
postulates; cybernetic schemas can only acquire a universal sense in a society that
is already constituted in a manner that conforms to this thought; the most difficult
reactivity to establish is that of a society in relation to cybernetic thought itself; it
can constitute itself only progressively and via the mediation of already established
channels of information, such as the exchanges, for example, between technics
working synergistically on a given point; it is this type of grouping that Norbert
Wiener cites as the source of this new technology, which is a technics of technics,
at the beginning of his Cybernetics, published in 1948 and which is a new Discourse
on M ethod , written by a mathematician teaching at an institute of technology.
Cybernetics grants man a new type of majority, one that penetrates the relations
of authority by distributing itself across the social body, and discovers the matu­
rity of reflection beyond the maturity of reason, thereby giving man, in addition
to the freedom to act, the power to create organization by establishing teleology.
Consequently both finality and organization, which can now be rationally thought
and created since they become a matter of technics, are no longer ulterior, superior
reasons, capable of justifying everything: if finality becomes an object of technics,
then there is something beyond finality in ethics; Cybernetics, in this sense, frees
man from the unconditional prestige of the idea of finality. Man freed himself,
through technics, from social constraint; through the technology of information,
he becomes creator o f this organization of solidarity that hitherto imprisoned him;
the stage of technical encyclopedism can only be provisional; it calls for a stage of a
technological encyclopedism that completes it by giving the individual a possibility
of returning to the social, which now changes status, and becomes the object of an
organizational construction, rather than being the acceptance of a valorized given
or one that is fought, but which subsists with its primitive characteristics, external
to the activity of man. Individual nature is thus no longer external to the human
domain. After acceding to freedom comes access to authority, in the full sense of
the term, i.e., that of creative force.

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

121

Such are the three stages of the encyclopedic spirit, which was first ethical, then
technical, and which can then become technological by going beyond the idea of
finality taken as ultimate justification.
However, it is wrong to say that the technics of finalized organization are useful
only because of their practical results; they are useful in the sense that they bring
finality from the magical level to the technical level. Whereas the evocation of a
superior end, and of the order that realizes this end, is considered to be the final
term in the search for its justification (because life is conflated with finality, in an
age when technical schemas are mere schemas of causality), the introduction of
technological schemas of finality in thought plays a cathartic role. That o f which
there is a technics cannot act as an ultimate justification. Both individual life and
social life contain many aspects of finalized processes, but perhaps finality is not
the most profound aspect of individual or social life, any more so than the different
modalities of finalized actions, such as adaptation to a milieu.
One could undoubtedly say that it is not a veritable finality that animates the
processes of recurrent causality with negative reaction; at the very least this techni­
cal production of teleological mechanisms enables the most inferior, most primitive
aspect of finality to leave the magical domain behind: the subordination of a means
to an end, hence the superiority of an end with respect to its means. By becom­
ing a technical matter, such organization is henceforth only one of the aspects of
social or individual life, and its prestige can no longer mask the possibilities for the
development, advent, and emergence of new forms, which cannot be justified by
finality, since they produce their own end as the last term of evolution; evolution
m aladapts as much as it adapts. The realization of adaptations is but one of life’s
aspects; homeostases are partial functions; technology, in incorporating them and
allowing them not only to be thought, but to be brought into existence rationally,
leaves the open processes of social and individual life fully exposed. In this sense,
technology reduces alienation.

TV - Necessity o f a synthesis between the m ajor a n d m inor modes
o f access to technics in the dom ain o f education

The separation between the education of the adult and the education of the child
in the area of technology corresponds to a difference in structure between the
two normative systems, and, to a certain extent, a difference between the results.

122

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

As a consequence a gap remains between pedagogical technology and encyclopedic
technology that has yet to be bridged.
Encyclopedic technological education aims at giving the adult the feeling that
he is a fulfilled, entirely realized being, in full possession of his means and his
forces, an image of the individual man in his state of real maturity; the necessary
condition of this feeling is the universality of knowledge in theory and in practice;
and yet within encyclopedic learning there remains something that is abstract, and
an irreducible lack of universality: the material combination of all technical devices
within a technological volume that assembles and coordinates them according to
an order of simultaneity or reason neglects the temporal, successive, quantic aspect
of the discoveries that have led to the current state; one grasps all at once and in
actuality what is progressively constructed, what is slowly and successively elab­
orated; the idea of progress, or rather what is mythical about it, comes from this
illusion of simultaneity, which presents as a fixed state what is merely a stage; by
excluding historicity, encyclopedism introduces man to the possession of a false
entelechy, because this stage is still rich in virtuality; there is no determinism that
presides over invention, and where progress is thought as being continuous, it
masks the very reality of invention. The autodidact is tempted to bring every­
thing back to the present: the past, insofar as he assembles it within his present
knowledge, and the future, to the extent that he considers it as necessarily flowing
in a continuous manner from the present through the intermediary of progress.
What the autodidact lacks is having been raised in a progressive way, which is to
say, having become an adult through a temporal series of developments that are
structured by crises determining and enabling the passage to another phase; the
historicity of technical coming-into-being must be grasped through the historicity
of the subjects coming-into-being so as to add the order of succession to the order
of simultaneity, according to a form that is time. A genuine encyclopedism, which
demands a temporal universality at the same time as a universality o f simultaneity,
must integrate the education of the child; it can only become truly universal if it
makes an adult by means of the child, by following the temporal universality so as
to obtain a universality of simultaneity; what must be discovered is the continuity
between the two forms of universality.
Inversely, non-technological education lacks the universality of simultaneity, this
is what is meant when one says that it sets its sights on culture rather than knowl­
edge; but any enterprise that aims to obtain culture by ridding itself of knowledge
would be illusory, because the encyclopedic order of knowledge is a part of cul­
ture; and yet, the encyclopedic order of knowledge can only be seen in an abstract
and consequently non-cultural way, if it is seen from outside of knowledge itself.

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

123

A representation of knowledge without knowledge itself can only occur if it is
grasped through an external symbol, as is the case for instance in the mythical and
socialized representation of men who “embody” knowledge: knowledge itself is
then replaced by the figure of the scholar, which is to say by a cataloged element of
social or characterological typology, which is totally inadequate to knowledge itself,
and introduces a mystification into culture making it inauthentic. At best, knowl­
edge can be replaced by an opinion, a biography, a character trait or a description
of the personality of a scholar; but these are once again totally inadequate elements,
because they do not introduce knowledge but rather an idolatry of the human
basis of knowledge, which is not o f the order of knowledge itself. There is more
authentic culture in the gesture of a child who reinvents a technical device, than
in a text where Chateaubriand describes the “terrifying genius” o f Blaise Pascal.
We are closer to invention when we seek to understand the cog-wheeled adding
device used in Pascals calculating machine (arithmetic machine) than when we
read the most oratorical passages relating to Pascals genius. To understand Pascal is
to reconstruct a machine identical to his with one's own hands without copying it,
even transposing it where possible to an electronic adding device, so as to have to
reinvent it by way of actualizing it, rather than reproducing Pascals intellectual and
operational schemas. To cultivate oneself is to actualize real human schemas ana­
logically, paying scant attention to the stir that this or that invention or publication
caused among its contemporaries, which is inessential, or at the very least cannot
be grasped other than with reference to an original thought, to invention itself.
It is regrettable that a cultured pupil in the last year of secondary school knows
Descartes’s vortices only through Bélise's simpering, and the state o f astronomy in
the seventeenth century through “that great long frightful spyglass” that Chrysale
cannot stand.13
This indicates a lack of seriousness, a lack of truth in thought, which has no
right to be presented as culture. Such evocations would have their place if they
could be situated with respect to their real source, which would be grasped first,
and not through the pharisaism of a work of art that has other objectives besides
culture. The encyclopedic order of simultaneity is expelled from cultural education
because it does not conform to the opinions of social groups, which never contain
a representation of the order of simultaneity, because all they represent is a minimal
fraction of life in a determined epoch, and they cannot situate themselves on their
own. This hiatus between contemporary life and culture comes from the alienation

o f culture, which is to say from the fact that culture, in reality, is an initiation into
the opinions o f determinate social groups having existed in previous epochs; the
primacy of literature in cultural education comes from this omnipotence of opin­
ion; a work [œuvre], in particular a work that has survived, is in fact a work that has
expressed the ethics of a group or of an epoch wherein this group could recognize
itself; a literary culture is thus enslaved to these groups; it is at the level of these
groups of the past. A literary work is a social witness. The entire share of didactic
works is eliminated from culture, unless it is ancient, and can be considered as a
witness to the didactic “genre.” Contemporary culture feigns to consider the didac­
tic genre as something extinct, when perhaps never before has there been as much
expressive force, as much art, as much human presence in scientific and technical
writings. It is really culture that has now become a genre with its fixed rules and
norms; it has lost its sense of universality.
Therefore education, in order for it to be fully educational, lacks human dyna­
misms. Considering in particular the technical aspect of this education and of
encyclopedism, it is plain to see that it constitutes a mediator of great value, since it
has aspects that make it accessible to the child and others that adequately symbol­
ize the successive stages of scientific knowledge; the stumbling block that cultural
education runs up against when it wants to become encyclopedic is the difficulty
attached to wanting to understand this science merely on the basis of discursive
intellectual symbols. Technical realization, on the contrary, provides the scientific
knowledge that serves as its principle of functioning, in the form of a dynamic
intuition that can even be apprehended by a young child, and which is susceptible
to becoming more and more elucidated, doubled by a discursive form of compre­
hension; truly discursive knowledge admits of no degrees, it is either immediately
perfect or false because it is inadequate. Through technics, encyclopedism could
thus find its place in the education of the child without requiring capacities for
abstraction, which the young child does not fully have at its disposal. In this sense,
the child’s acquisition of technological knowledge can initiate an intuitive encyclo­
pedism, grasped through the nature [caractère] of the technical object. The technical
object in fact distinguishes itself from the scientific object because the scientific
object is an analytical object, which aims at analyzing a unique effect in all its most
precise conditions and characteristics, whereas the technical object, far from being
situated in its entirety within the context o f a particular science, is in fact at a point
of concurrence of a multitude of data and scientific effects coming from the most
varied domains, integrating what appear to be the most heteroclite forms of knowl­
edge [savoirs], and which can in some cases not be coordinated intellectually, while

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

125

they are indeed coordinated practically in the functioning of the technical object; it
has been said that the technical object is the result of the art of compromise; what it
is, is indeed an eminently synthetic structure, which cannot be understood in any
other way than through the introduction of a synthetic schematism that presides
over invention. The technical schema, which is a relation between several structures
and a complex operation taking place through these structures, is by its very nature
encyclopedic, since it leads to a circularity of knowledge, a synergy of elements of
knowledge that are still theoretically heterogeneous.
Perhaps it should be noted that until the twentieth century, technics were inca­
pable of assuming this relation between the encyclopedic work and the culture
given to the child. For indeed it was almost impossible at the time to find, within
technics, truly universal operations, including the schematisms of sensation or
of thought. Today the existence of a technics of information gives technology an
infinitely greater universality. Information theory places technology at the center
of a large number of diverse sciences, such as physiology, logic, aesthetics, phonetic
or grammatical study and even the semantics of languages, numerical calculus,
geometry, the theory of organization of groups and o f regimes of authority, the
calculus of probability, and all the technics of transport of spoken, acoustic or
visual information. Information theory is an inter-scientific theory that enables
the systematization of scientific concepts as much as the systematization of the
schematisms of various technics; information theory mustn’t be considered as a
technics among technics; in reality it is a thinking that acts as mediator between
the various technics on the one hand, between the various sciences on the other,
and finally between the sciences and technics; it can play this role because there are
relations between the sciences that are not only theoretical, but also instrumental
and technical, each science being capable of making use of a certain number of
other sciences for its own benefit, which it uses as technical sources in order to
carry out the effect it studies; a technical relation takes place between the sci­
ences; technics, moreover, can be theorized in a scientific form; information theory
intervenes as a science of technics and as a technics of the sciences, determining a
reciprocal state of these exchange functions.
It is at this level, and at this level only, that encyclopedism and technical edu­
cation can meet, within a coherence of two simultaneous and successive orders
of universality.
We can thus say that, if to this day technics could only provide two difficult-to-reconcile dynamisms — one of which is geared toward the adult and the
other toward the child, with information theory — then this antagonism today

126

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

gives way to a mediating discipline that establishes continuity between specializa­
tion and encyclopedism, between the education o f the child and that of the adult.
What is thereby founded is a reflexive technology above and beyond the different
technics, and what is thereby defined is a thinking that creates a relation between
the sciences and technics.
The consequence of this reflexive unification of technics and the end of the
opposition between theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge for the reflex­
ive conception of man is considerable; once this level has been reached, there is
effectively no longer a hiatus or an antagonism between the time of education and
adulthood; the order of succession and the order of simultaneity organize them­
selves in a relation of reciprocity, and adulthood is no longer antagonistic with
respect to that of education. To a certain extent even the evolution of societies,
stuck, up till now, on a determinism of youth, then of maturity and finally of
old age, along with the political and social regimes corresponding to each, can
no longer be conceived as fatal if the penetration of technics is deep enough
to introduce a system of references and values that are independent of this
implicit biologism.
A careful analysis o f the dualisms in value systems, such as those between the
manual laborer and the intellectual, the peasant and the citizen, the child and the
adult, would show that underneath these oppositions there is a technical reason
for the incompatibility between several groups of schematisms; the manual laborer
is the one who lives according to an intuitive schematism at the level of material
things; the intellectual, on the contrary, is the one who has conceptualized the
sensible qualities; he lives in accordance with an order that stabilizes the order
of succession by way of définitions of nature and the destiny of man; he holds a
certain power of conceptualizing and of valorizing or devaluing human gestures
and values lived at the level of intuition. The manual laborer lives according to the
order of simultaneity; he is an autodidact when he wants to gain access to a culture.
It is according to this same difference between schematisms that the man of the
countryside is opposed to the city dweller. The man of the countryside is contem­
porary with a set [ensemble] of requirements and participations that make him a
being who is integrated into a natural system of existence; his tendencies and his
intuitions are the links of this integration. The city dweller is an individual being,
linked to a social coming-into-being rather than to a natural order. He is the oppo­
site of the man of the countryside in the way that an abstract and cultivated being is
the opposite of an integrated and uncultivated being. The city dweller is of a time,
whereas the man of the countryside is of a place or region; the former integrates

MAN AND HIS RELATION TO THE TECHNICAL GIVEN

127

himself into the order of succession, the latter, into the order o f simultaneity.
The attachment to traditions by the man of the countryside is generally what is
noted; but tradition is precisely the most unconscious aspect of historicity, which
masks the representations of the successive order, and which supposes an invari­
ance of succession. Real traditionalism is based on the absence o f a representation
of the series of coming-into-being; this coming-into-being is repressed [enfoui]. In
the end, the opposition between the child and the adult summarizes these antago­
nisms; the child is the being of succession, made of virtualities, modifying himself
in time and being aware of this modification and o f this change. The adult, capable
of facing the simultaneity of problems that life confronts him with because of his
education, integrates himself into society according to the order o f simultaneity.
However, this maturity can only be fully achieved to the extent that society is stable
and is not evolving too rapidly, otherwise a society that is in the process o f trans­
forming itself, in privileging the order o f succession, communicates a dynamism to
its adult members that turns them into adolescents.

I. - The different modalities o f the notion o f progress

The encyclopedists’ attitude toward technics can be considered an enthusiasm
roused by the discovery of the technicity of the elements. Machines are not, in
fact, directly considered automata by the encyclopedists; rather, they are consid­
ered an assemblage of elementary devices. Diderot’s collaborators directed their
attention essentially to the organs of machines. In the eighteenth century, the tech­
nical ensemble was still at the scale of the cork cutter’s workshop or that of the
scale maker’s; this ensemble links up with technical elements through the inter­
mediary of the craftsman who uses tools or machine-tools, rather than through
the intermediary of veritable technical individuals. The division of subjects for
study is consequently made according to rubrics of utilization and not according to
schemas of technics, i.e., according to types of machines; the principle in grouping
and analyzing technical beings is the denomination of the trade, rather than that
of the machine. Very different trades, however, can make use of identical or almost
identical tools. This principle of grouping thus leads to a certain superfluity of the
presentation of tools and instruments which, from one illustration to the next, can
be closely related forms.
The principle of grouping according to technical ensembles comprised of an
indefinite plurality of elements, however, is linked very closely to the idea of con­
tinuous progress such as it existed for the Encyclopedists. It is when technicity is

130

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

grasped at the level of elements that technical evolution can occur according to a
continuous line. There is a correlation between a molecular mode of the existence
of technicity and a continuous pace of the evolution of technical objects. Gears
and screw threads were cut better in the eighteenth century than in the seventeenth
century; from this comparison between the same elements made in the seventeenth
and in the eighteenth century arose the idea o f the continuity of progress as a
forward march in what we have called the concretization of technical objects. The
evolution of this element, which takes place within already constituted technical
ensembles, does not provoke any upheaval: it improves the results of fabrication
without brutality, and authorizes the craftsman to preserve habitual methods,
while experiencing the feeling of facilitation at work; the habitual gestures, better
served by more precise instruments, now yield better results. The optimism of the
eighteenth century is to a large extent based on the elementary and continuous
improvement of the conditions of technical work. Anxiety effectively arises from
those transformations that provoke a break within the rhythms of everyday life,
making the old habitual gestures useless. But the improvement of the tools tech­
nicity plays a euphoric role. When man, while preserving the fruit of his training,
exchanges an old tool for a new tool whose manipulation is the same, he has the
feeling of having more precise, skillful, and rapid gestures; it is the entire corporeal
schema that expands against his limitations, that dilates and frees itself; the impres­
sion o f awkwardness diminishes: the trained man feels more skillful with a better
tool; he has greater self-confidence; for the tool is an extension of the organ, and is
carried by the gesture.
The eighteenth century was the pivotal moment for the development of tools
and instruments, if by tool one understands the technical object enabling one to
prolong and arm the body in order to accomplish a gesture, and by instrument the
technical object that enables one to prolong and adapt the body in order to achieve
better perception; the instrument is a tool of perception. Some technical objects
are both tools and instruments, but they can be called tools or instruments accord­
ing to the predominance of their active function or of their perceptive function: a
hammer is a tool, even though, through the receptors of kinaesthetic and vibratory
tactile sensitivity, we can subtly perceive the instant when the nail starts to writhe
or to split the wood and penetrate it too fast; the hammer must effectively act on
the tip so as to drive it in, so that, according to the manner in which this opera­
tion of driving in the tip is executed, definite information is communicated to the
senses of the one who holds the hammer in his hand; the hammer is thus first a
tool, since it is as a result of its tool-function that it can serve as an instrument;

CURRENT PROBLEMS

even when the hammer is used as a pure instrument, it is still, primarily, a tool: the
mason recognizes the quality of a stone with his hammer, but for this to happen
the hammer must first partially chip away at the stone. Conversely, a telescope or
a microscope are instruments, in the same manner as a level or a sextant are: these
objects serve to collect information without accomplishing any prior action on the
world. And the eighteenth century is the age in which both tools and instruments
were made with greater care, reaping the rewards of seventeenth century discoveries
within static and dynamic mechanics, as well as those found in geometrical and
physical optics. The undeniable progress of the sciences was translated into the
progress of technical elements. This accord between scientific investigation and
technical consequences is a new reason for optimism that adds itself to the content
of the notion of progress, through the spectacle of this synergy and this fecundity
of the domains of human activity: the instruments, improved by the sciences, are
at the service of scientific investigation.
The aspect of technical evolution changes, on the contrary, when the birth of
complete technical individuals is encountered in the nineteenth century. As long
as these individuals merely replace animals, the perturbation is not a frustration.
The steam engine replaces the horse in hauling wagons; it drives the spinning mill:
gestures are modified to a certain extent, but man is not replaced insofar as the
machine simply provides a greater utilization of energy sources. The Encyclopedists
were familiar with the windmill, which they magnified and represented as domi­
nating the landscape from the height of its tall silent structure. Several extremely
detailed illustrations are dedicated to new and improved water mills. Mans frustra­
tion starts with the machine that replaces man, with the automatic weaving loom,
with the forging press, with the equipment of the new factories; what the worker
destroys during a riot are the machines, because they are his rivals; the machine
is no longer simply an engine but a bearer o f tools; eighteenth century progress
left the human being intact because the human individual remained a technical
individual among his tools of which he was both the center and bearer. It is not
necessarily through its size that the factory distinguishes itself from the craftsmans
workshop, but through the change in relation between the technical object and
the human being: the factory is a technical ensemble that is comprised of auto­
matic machines, whose activity is parallel to that of human activity; the factory
uses true technical individuals, whereas, in the workshop, it is man who lends his
individuality to the accomplishment of technical actions. From then on the most
positive, most direct aspect, of the first notion of progress, is no longer experienced
[éprouvé\. The progress of the eighteenth century is a progress experienced by an

132

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

individual through the force, speed, and precision of his gestures. The progress of
the nineteenth century can no longer be experienced by the individual, because
it is no longer centralized with the individual as the center of command and per­
ception in the adapted action. The individual becomes the mere spectator of the
results of the functioning o f the machines, or the one who is responsible for the
organization of technical ensembles putting the machines to work. This is why
the notion of progress splits in two, becomes aggressive, ambivalent, and a source
of anxiety; progress is at a remove from man and no longer makes sense for the
individual, because the conditions of the individuals intuitive perception of prog­
ress no longer exist; this implicit judgment, which is very close to that of kinesthetic
impressions and to the facilitation of a corporeal dynamism which formed the
basis of the notion of progress in the eighteenth century, disappears, except within
domains of activity in which the progress of the sciences and of technics provides,
as in the eighteenth century, an extension and facilitation of individual conditions
of action and observation (as is the case with medicine and surgery).
Progress is henceforth thought of as cosmic, at the level of its overall results. It
is thought abstractly, intellectually, in a doctrinal manner. Progress is no longer
thought by craftsmen, but by mathematicians, who conceive of progress as man
taking possession of nature. Beginning with the Saint-Simonians, this idea of prog­
ress starts to support technocratism. An idea of progress that was conceived and
desired substitutes itself for the impression of progress as something undergone
[éprouvé\. The individual who thinks progress is not the same individual as the one
who works, except in some rather rare cases, such as the case of the printer and
lithographer, who have mostly remained craftsmen. Even in these cases, for those
who think deeply about its nature, the advent of the machine is expressive of an
aspiration for the transformation of social structures. One could say that work and
technicity were linked in the eighteenth century through the experience [épreuve]
of elementary progress. Conversely, the twentieth century brings about the dis­
junction of the conditions for the intellection of progress and for the experience of
the internal rhythms of work resulting from this same progress. Nineteenth cen­
tury man does not experience progress as a worker: he experiences it as an engineer
or a user. In fact, the engineer,14 the man of the machine, becomes the organizer of
the ensemble made up of workers and machines. Progress is grasped as a movement
that manifests itself through its results, rather than as progress in itself understood
as the ensemble of operations that constitute it, as the elements that actualize it,
and as being valid for a large number of people that would be coextensive with
humanity.

Indeed the poets of the end of the first half of the nineteenth century keenly felt
progress to be the general march of humanity, with its charge of risk and anxiety.
Within this progress there is something of an immense collective adventure, of a
voyage and even of a migration toward another world. This progress contains at
once something triumphant and crepuscular. It is perhaps the word that Vigny sees
written above the cities in L a M aison du berger [The Shepherds house]. The feeling
of ambivalence toward the machine can be found in the evocation of the locomo­
tive and the compass, the former in L a M aison du berger, the latter in L a Bouteille
à la mer [The Bottle in the sea]. The latter poem shows how Vigny felt about
the transient (and perhaps transitory because contradictory) nature of progress in
the nineteenth century. This unfinished, incomplete idea of progress, contains a
message for posterity; it cannot fulfill itself within itself. One o f the aspects o f Les
Destinées [Destinies] is to accept living within this moment of technical evolution.
Vigny made it accurate and significant by understanding that technical evolution
could not satisfy itself by way of itself, that it couldn’t simply close in on itself.
A third aspect of the notion of technical progress emerges with the repercussions
of the internal regulation of technical individuals regarding technical ensembles,
and, through these, regarding humanity. The second stage, that which corresponds
to the arrival of a new wave of technics at the level o f individuals, was character­
ized by the ambivalence of progress, by dual situation of man with regard to the
machine, and by the production of alienation. This alienation grasped by Marxism
as having its root in the relation of the worker with the means of production, does
not only derive, in our view, from a relation of property or non-property between
worker and the instruments of work. Beneath this juridical and economic relation
exists an even more profound relation, that of the continuity between the human
individual and the technical individual, or of the discontinuity between these two
beings. The reason why alienation arises is not solely because in the nineteenth
century the human individual who works is no longer the owner of his means of
production, whereas in the eighteenth century the craftsman was the owner of his
instruments of production and of his tools. Alienation does indeed emerge the
moment the worker is no longer the owner o f his means of production, but it does
not emerge solely because of this rupture in the link of property. It also emerges
outside of all collective relation to the means of production, at the physiological
and psychological level of the individual properly speaking. The alienation of man
in relation to the machine does not only have a socio-economic sense; it also has a
physio-psychological sense; the machine no longer prolongs the corporeal schema,
neither for workers, nor for those who possess the machines. Bankers whose social

134

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

role has been exalted by mathematicians such as the Saint-Simonians and Auguste
Comte are as alienated in their relation to the machine as the members of the pro­
letariat. What we mean by this is that there is no need to presuppose a master-slave
dialectic in order to account for the existence of alienation within the proprietor
class. The relation of property with respect to the machine contains as much alien­
ation as the relation o f non-property, even if it corresponds to a very different
social state. On either side of the machine, above and below, the worker, who is a
man of elements, and the industrial boss, who is a man of ensembles, both lack a
true relation with the individualized technical object in the form of the machine.
Labor and capital are two modes of being where one is as incomplete as the other
with respect to the technical object and the technicity contained in industrial orga­
nization. Their apparent symmetry does not at all mean that the union of capital
and of labor reduces alienation. The alienation of capital is not alienation with
respect to labor, with respect to the contact with the world (as in the master/slave
dialectic), but rather with respect to the technical object; the same goes for labor;
what labor lacks is not what capital possesses, and what capital lacks is not what
labor possesses. Labor possesses the intelligence of elements, capital possesses the
intelligence o f ensembles; but it is not by combining the intelligence of elements
with the intelligence of ensembles that one can arrive at the intelligence of the
interm ediary a n d non m ixed being that is the technical individual. Element, indi­
vidual, and ensemble follow each other along a temporal line; the man of the
element is late with respect to the individual; but the man of ensembles who has
not understood the individual is in no way ahead of his time with respect to it;
he tries to enclose the present technical individual in the structure of an ensemble
belonging to the past. Labor and capital are both late with respect to the technical
individual that is a depository of technicity. The technical individual is not of the
same era as the labor that enacts it and the capital that frames it.
The dialogue between capital and labor is false because it is of the past. The
collectivization of the means of production cannot achieve a reduction of alien­
ation on its own; it can only achieve this reduction if it is the precondition for
the acquisition of the intelligence of the individuated technical object by the
human individual. This relation between the human individual and the technical
individual is the most difficult to form. It presupposes a technical culture, which
introduces the capacity of different attitudes rather than that of work and of action
(work corresponding to the intelligence of the elements and action to the intelli­
gence of ensembles). What work and action have in common is the predominance
of finality over causality; in both cases, the effort is directed at a certain result to

CURRENT PROBLEMS

135

be obtained; the employment of means finds itself in the position of minority
with respect to the result: the schema of action matters less than the result of the
action. In the technical individual, however, this disequilibrium between causality
and finality disappears; viewed from the outside the machine is m ade in order to
obtain a certain result; but, the more the technical being becomes individualized,
the more this external finality effaces itself for the benefit of the internal coherence
of functioning; the functioning is finalized with respect to itself before being so in
its relation with the external world. Such is the automatism o f the machine, and
such is its self-regulation: there is, at the level of regulations, a functioning, and not
only a causality or finality; in self-regulated functioning, all causality has a sense of
finality, and all finality a sense of causality.
II. - Critique o f the relation between m an a n d the technical object
as it is presented by the notion o f progress arisin g fro m thermodynamics
a n d energetics. Recourse to Inform ation Theory

Within man, what can be in a relation with the individualized technical being is
the intuition of the schemas of functioning; as a being who participates in its regu­
lation, man can be coupled to the machine as an equal, and not merely as a being
who directs or utilizes it through the incorporation of ensembles, or as a being who
serves it by supplying matter and elements. By this we mean to say that neither an
economic theory nor an energetic theory can account for such a coupling of man
and machine. Economic or energetic links are too external for it to be possible
to define this true coupling through them. There is an inter-individual coupling
between man and machine when the same self-regulating functions are better
and more subtly accomplished by the man-machine couple than by man or
machine alone.
Let’s take the case of what we call memory. Leaving aside all the mythologi­
cal assimilations of vital functions to artificial operations, one can say that man
and machine present two complementary aspects of the use that is made of the
past. The machine is capable of retaining monomorphic documents that are very
complex, richly detailed, and precise for a very long time. A magnetic tape three
hundred meters long can keep a recording o f the magnetic translation o f any noise
or sound in a bandwidth of 50 to 10,000 Hz, corresponding to about an hour’s
listening-time, or two hours if one accepts a reduction of the frequency band to
an upper limit of 5,000 Hz. A roll of film of the same size can record scenes that

136

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

take about half an hour to play, with a definition of about 500 lines, that is to say
in a way that makes it possible to distinguish about 250,000 pixels on every image.
Magnetic tape can thus record 3,600,000 sonic events, each one distinct from the
others; cinematographic film stock can record 120 million pixels, each one distinct
from the others. (The difference in these figures does not derive solely from the fact
that the grain of a magnetic strip is larger than that of the sensitive film; in fact, it
is of the same size; it comes primarily from the fact that the recording of sound cor­
responds to a linear track on a tape, whereas the recording of images corresponds to
the splicing of successive surfaces in which almost every one of the sensitive pixels
can become a carrier of information.) Now, what characterizes the conservation
function of this machine is that it is absolutely without structure; film does not
record clear-cut figures, geometrical images for instance, any better than the disor­
dered image of grains in a pile o f sand; to a certain extent the vivid oppositions of
clear cut surfaces are even less well recorded than the disordered uniformity of the
grains of sand, because of the phenomena of light diffusion in the film base, which
create the so-called halo effect, around very bright and clearly delineated areas.
Similarly, magnetic tape does not record continuous and well-formed musical
sounds any better than transitional tones or noises: there is no order in the preser­
vation of recordings by the machine, which does not possess the faculty of selecting
forms. Human perception distinguishes forms, perceptual units, when looking at
or listening to recorded documents. But the recording itself does not really con­
tain these forms. The inability of the data-preserving function of the machines is
relative to the recording and reproduction o f forms. This incapacity is general, it
exists at every level. A considerable intricacy is needed in order for a calculating
machine to be capable of writing results in clearly legible figures on a cathode ray
tube screen. The numeroscope is made o f very delicate and complex combinations,
using encodings in order to obtain lines that can somehow reproduce numbers. It
is far easier to reproduce Lissajous figures than to write the number 5. The machine
cannot retain forms, but merely a translation of forms, by means of an encoding
in a spatial or temporal distribution. This distribution may be very durable, like
that of a magnetic tape, definitive, like that of silver grains in chemically sensitive
film, or altogether provisional, like that of the series of pulses passing through a
mercury column with a piezo-electric crystal at each end, used in certain types of
calculating machines for the preservation of partial results during the course of the
operation; it can also be very fleeting but sustained, as in the case of the recording
of numbers on a mosaic in a certain type of cathode ray tube somewhat like the
iconoscope, and equipped with two electron guns, one for reading and inscription,

CURRENT PROBLEMS

137

the other for upkeep (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology RCA Selectron
and storage tube). The plasticity of the support must not be confused with a true
plasticity in the recording function; it is possible to erase the numbers inscribed
on the beryllium mosaic of the selectron to the thousandth of a second, and to
replace them with others, but the speed with which successive recordings succeed
each other on this same support in no way means that the recording itself is plastic;
each recording, taken in itself, is perfectly rigid. It is obviously possible to erase the
magnetization of the oxide grains from the magnetic strip in order to make another
recording. But the new recording is completely separate from the preceding one;
if the first is poorly erased, it interferes with the next recording, blurring it, rather
than facilitating it.
In human memory, on the contrary, it is the form that is preserved: preservation
itself is only a limited aspect of memory, which is the power o f selecting forms, of
schematizing experience. The machine would be capable o f performing a similar
function only if the already-recorded magnetic tape was superior to a new tape in
recording certain sound figures, which is not the case. The plasticity in the memory
of machines is that of the medium, whereas in human memory it is the plasticity
of the content itself.15 One can say that, in man, the function of preserving rec­
ollections resides in memory, because memory, conceived as a set [ensemble] of
forms, of schemas, receives the recollection it records because memory connects
the recollection with its forms; in a machine, on the contrary, recording occurs
without prior memory. From this essential difference comes human memory’s sig­
nificant incapacity for fixing elements without order. It would take a very long
time to learn the relative positions of fifty tokens of different colors and shapes
emptied on a table in disorder; even a blurred photographic view is more useful
than a human witness when it comes to affirming the relative position of various
objects in space. Machine memory triumphs in multiplicity and disorder; human
memory triumphs in the unity of forms and in order. Every time a function of inte­
gration or comparison appears, the most complex and best-built machine provides
results that are considerably inferior to those that human memory can achieve. A
calculating machine can be coded in order to translate, but its translation remains
very elementary and crude. It presupposes a prior reduction of each of the two lan­
guages on a simplified basis, along with a reduced vocabulary and a fixed number
of turns of phrase. For the machine lacks the plasticity of integration, which is the
15.
An unused magnetic tape is equal to or superior to an already used tape, even if only for registering the same form sev­
eral times in a row. A cathode ray tube on which the same image is continually fixed, far from becoming better at registering
it, loses its sensitivity in areas occupied by the image, so much so that after prolonged use it is more sensitive to new images,
which do not form at the same points as the older ones.

138

vital aspect of memory through which it distinguishes itself in that very instant
from machine memory: the storageXG of the calculator or the translating machine
(which is nothing but a classical calculating machine coded in a certain way) is very
different from the function o f the present through which memory exists, in man, at
the very level of perception, through perception, making sense of the present word
according to the general turn of phrase and of earlier phrases, or even according
to the totality o f experience acquired in the past regarding the person who speaks.
Human memory receives contents that have a formative power in the sense that
they overlap with themselves, are grouped, as if acquired experience served as a
code for new acquisitions, in order to interpret and fix them: in man and more
generally in the living being content becomes coding, whereas in the machine coding
and content remain separate as condition and conditioned. Content introduced
into human memory will superimpose itself on prior content and take form on it:
the living is that in which the a posteriori becomes a p rio ri ; memory is the function
by which a posteriori matters become a priori.
A complex technical operation, however, requires the use of both forms of
memory. Non-living memory, the memory of the machine, is useful in cases where
faithfulness in the preservation of details outweighs the syncretic nature of a rec­
ollection integrated into experience, having signification through its relation with
other elements. Machine memory is the memory of the document, of the result
of measurement. Mans memory is that which, after an interval of many years,
evokes a situation because it involves the same significations, the same feelings,
the same dangers as another, or simply because this similarity makes sense accord­
ing to the implicit vital coding constituted by experience. In both cases memory
allows self-regulation; but human memory enables a self-regulation according to
an ensemble of significations valid in the living and capable of developing only in
the latter; that of the machine grounds a self-regulation that makes sense in the
world of non-living beings. The significations according to which human memory
functions stop where those according to which machine memory functions begin.
The coupling of man to machine begins to exist from the very moment when a
coding common to both of these memories can be discovered, in order for a partial
convertibility of one into the other to be realized, so that a synergy can become
possible. One case of this coupling is provided by the permanent data file of tele­
phone calls. The summarized information recording up-to-date results recently
obtained from multiple domains classed under different rubrics is recorded on
magnetic tapes. A catalog and a telephone call system make it possible, through16

CURRENT PROBLEMS

139

the use of selectors, to rapidly obtain a read-out of what has been recorded on any
of the magnetic tapes. Here, human memory is where the words and names o f the
rubrics have signification. The machine, on the contrary, is where a series of defi­
nite pulses provokes one magnetic tape player to be powered and not another: this
fixed and rigid faculty for selection is very different from the one that prompts the
inquirer to dial one particular phone number rather than another. This pure case o f
coupling between machine and man helps us to understand the mode of coupling
that exists in other cases: there is coupling when a single and complete function
is carried out by both beings. Such a possibility exists every time that a technical
function has a defined self-regulation. Functions that contain a self-regulation are
the ones where the accomplishment of a task is directed not only by a model to be
copied (according to an end), but by a partial result of the accomplishment of the
task, intervening as a condition. In the artisanal operation, this control through
information gathering is frequent; man being at once the mover [moteur ] tool
and the perceiving subject regulates his action according to instantaneous partial
results. The tool is at once tool and instrument, which is to say a means of action
prolonging the organs and a channel o f recurring information. The machine, on the
contrary, as a complete closed individual replacing man, generally has no system of
self-regulation: it goes through the motions of a stereotypy of successive gestures
according to a predetermined conditioning. This first type of machine is what one
could call a mechanical being without self-regulation. It is indeed a practical tech­
nical unit, but not a technical individual strictly speaking.
Despite appearances, it is, on the contrary, the truly automatic machine that
least replaces man, because the function of regulation that exists in this machine
presupposes a variability in its operation, an adaptability of its functioning to
the completion of this work. A rather elementary enthusiasm for self-regulating
automata lets us forget that these machines are precisely the ones that are most reli­
ant on man; while the other machines need man simply as a servant or organizer,
self-regulating machines need man as a technician, which is to say as an associate;
their relation to man is situated at the level of this regulation, not at the level of
elements or ensembles. But it is through this regulation that automatic machines
can be linked to the technical ensemble in which they function. Just as the human
individual is not linked to the group by his elementary functions, whether active
or perceptive, but by his self-regulation which gives him his personality and char­
acter, so the machine is integrated with the ensemble not only in an abstract and
preliminary way, by its function, but also, at every moment, by the way it performs
its own task according to the requirements of the ensemble. Th ere is no such thing

140

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

as a purely internal, entirely isolated self-regulation; the results of the action are
not merely results in themselves but also in relation to their external milieu, to the
ensemble. Now this aspect of self-regulation in which the whole o f the milieu must
be taken into account cannot be achieved by the machine alone, even if it is perfectly
automated. The type of memory and the type of perception needed for this aspect
of regulation call for the integration and transformation of the a posteriori into the
a p rio ri which only the living thing can achieve within itself. There is something
alive in a technical ensemble, and the integrative function of life can be ensured
only by human beings; the human being has the capacity to understand the func­
tioning of the machine, on the one hand, and the capacity to live, on the other: one
can speak o f technical life as being that which actualizes this relation between these
two functions in man. Man is capable o f taken upon himself the relation between
the living being that he is and the machine he fabricates; the technical operation
requires both technical and natural life.
Technical life, however, does not consist in overseeing machines, but in exist­
ing at the same level as a being that takes charge of the relation between them,
capable of being coupled, simultaneously or successively, with several machines.
Each machine can be compared to a monad, isolated in itself. The capacities of
the machine are only those that have been put in it by its constructor: it unfolds
its properties just as substance develops its attributes. The machine results from its
essence. Man, on the contrary, is not a monad, for in him the a posteriori becomes
a p rio ri , the event becomes a principle. Man as technician does not perform this
function prior to the manufacture of machines, but during their operation. He
fulfills the function of the present, and maintains the correlation because his life
consists of the rhythm of the machines that surround him and that he connects
to one another. He fulfills the function of integration, and prolongs self-reg­
ulation beyond each monad of automatism through the interconnection and
inter-commutation of monads. The technician is indeed in a certain sense the
man of ensembles, but in a very different way from the one that characterizes
the industrialist. The industrialist, in the same way as the worker, is pushed by
finality: he targets a result; herein lies their alienation; the technician is the man
of the operation in the course of its accomplishment; he does not take charge of
directing the ensemble but rather guides its self-regulation during functioning. He
absorbs within himself the sense of the work and the sense of the industrial direc­
tion. He is the man who knows the internal schemas of functioning and organizes
them in relation to each other. On the contrary, machines are ignorant of general
solutions and cannot resolve general problems. Whenever it is possible to replace a

CURRENT PROBLEMS

141

complex operation by a greater number of simple operations, this procedure is used
in the machine; this is the case for calculating machines that use a binary system
of numeration (rather than a decimal system) and reduce all operations to a series
of additions.17
In this sense one can affirm that the birth o f a technical philosophy at the level
of ensembles is possible only through an in-depth study of regulations, which is
to say of information. True technical ensembles are not the ones that use technical
individuals, but those that form a fabric of technical individuals through a rela­
tion of interconnection. Any philosophy of technics that starts from the reality
of ensembles using technical individuals without putting them into a relation of
information remains a philosophy of human power through technics, not a phi­
losophy of technics. One could use the term “autocratic philosophy of technics”
for a philosophy that takes the technical ensemble as a place where machines are
used in order to obtain power [puissance ]. The machine is only a means; the end
is the conquest of nature, the domestication o f natural forces by means of a first
act of enslavement: the machine is .a slave whose purpose is to make other slaves.
Such a dominating and enslaving inspiration can coincide with the quest for mans
freedom. But it is difficult to free oneself by transferring slavery onto other beings,
men, animals, or machines; to reign over a people of machines that enslave the
entire world is still to reign, and every reign presupposes the acceptance of the
schemas of enslavement.
Technocratic philosophy itself is affected by an enslaving violence, insofar as it
is technocratic. A technicism that comes from a reflection on autocratic technical
ensembles is inspired by the unbridled will to conquer. It is immoderate, and lacks
internal control and self-mastery. It is a force that is unleashed and which can only
perpetuate itself for the duration of the ascending phase of success or conquest.
Saint-Simonism triumphed under the Second Empire because there were train
platforms to be built, railway track to be laid, bridges and viaducts to be spread
across the valleys, and tunnels to be pierced through mountains. This aggressive
conquest has the characteristics of a rape of nature. Man enters into possession of
the earths bowels, traverses and labors, trespasses onto what had previously been
unreachable. Thus technocracy in a certain sense implies a violation of the sacred.
To throw a bridge over an inland sea, to attach an island to the continent, to pierce
an isthmus, is to modify the configuration of the earth, to undermine its natural
integrity. There is a pride of domination in this violence, and man entitles himself
as creator or at least foreman of creation: he plays the role of the demiurge. It is
17. The fundamental vital processes are, on the contrary, processes of integration.

142

Faust’s dream, being played out by an entire society, by all technicians. Indeed, the
development of technics is not enough for technocratism to emerge. Technocratism
represents a will to acquire power that comes to light in a group of men possessing
knowledge but not power, the knowledge of technics but not the money to put
them to work or the legislative power to free themselves of all constraint. In France,
technocrats are essentially poly-technicians,18which is to say men who, with respect
to technics, find themselves in a situation of being intelligent users and organizers
of technics rather than veritable technicians. These mathematicians think in sets
[ensembles], not in individual operational units; what holds their attention is not so
much the machine as enterprise.
Furthermore, and essentially, in an even more profound way, the conditioning
arising from the state of technics comes to be added onto that of psychosocial
conditioning. The nineteenth century could produce only a technological techno­
cratic philosophy because it discovered engines and not regulations. It is the age
of thermodynamics. However, in a certain sense, an engine is indeed a technical
individual since it cannot function without a certain number of regulations, or at
the very least a certain number of automatisms (intake, exhaust); but these autom­
atisms are auxiliary; their function is to enable the renewal of the cycle. Sometimes
the addition to stationary machines o f veritable self-regulators, such as Watt’s gov­
ernor (a centrifugal regulator, called a ball regulator), individualizes the heat engine
in a very complete way; regulators nevertheless remain accessories. When a thermal
machine has to generate great momentum, in accordance with an extremely inter­
mittent working condition [régime], it is good to have a man keeping watch nearby
who can press the regulator-lever before the load increases, because the regulator,
by intervening with too much of a delay, risks intervening when the engine has
already slowed down because of the sudden load increase: this is what happens
when a steam engine is used to cut large tree trunks into planks; once the regulator
kicks in without human intervention, the circular saw has already stalled, or the
belt has already fallen: the operator hits the regulator-lever a half-second before
the saw-wheel cuts into the trunk; the engine thus functions at full speed and is
accelerating when the work load suddenly increases. On the other hand, the Watt
regulator is extremely efficient and precise when load variations become slower
and gradual. Such incapacity for rapid variations can be explained by the fact that,
in thermodynamic engines, even when there is self-regulation, it has no information channels that are separate from the effectors. There is effectively a feed-back
18. An allusion to France's elite École polytechnique (whose students and alumni are called polytechniciens) and to other
polytechnic schools founded, along with other Grandes Écoles, in the long aftermath o f the Revolution in order to train the

information channel in the Watt governor, a channel o f counter-reaction {feed- back),
but this information is transmitted through a channel that is not distinct from the
one used by the motive power that allows the engine to move a resistant organ:
the regulator is connected to the output shaft; the whole ensemble made up of the
fly-wheels, the main shaft, the volumetric cylinder device and then the system for
transforming alternating movement into circular movement must therefore already
have slowed down through the loss of its kinetic energy so that the regulator can
intervene by increasing the admission time of the engine and consequently also
its power. Now, there is a serious drawback in this lack o f distinction between the
motive power channel (the energy channel) and the feedback channel (the infor­
mation channel), which greatly reduces the effectiveness o f regulation, and the
extent of the individualization of the technical being: when the engine slows down
(which is necessary in order for the regulator to come into action), the decrease in
running speed causes a decrease in power (the engine power, in low or medium
working conditions [régime], where the throttling of steam in the sliding valve
does not come into play, is proportional to the sum of all the elementary work
performed by successive piston strokes in a unit of time). The decrease in angular
speed results in the deterioration of the very conditions o f reactivity that the regu­
lator is designed to provoke.
It is this lack of distinction between the energy channel and the information
channel that marks the thermodynamic age, and constitutes the limit of the indi­
vidualization of thermal engines. Suppose on the contrary that a gauge measures
the torque on the transmission shaft at the outlet of a heat engine at every moment,
and that the result of this measurement is sent back to steam intake (or fuel intake
or carburized air-intake if it is an internal combustion engine), so as to increase
steam-intake in relation to the increased resistance exerted on the transmission
shaft; the pathway by which the resistance measurement then is fed back into
the steam supply and modifies it is thus distinct from the energy channel (steam,
cylinder, piston-rod, crank shaft, axle, transmission shaft); there is no need for the
engine to slow down for its power to increase: the information sampling rate along
the information channel can be extremely high with respect to the time constants
of the energy channel, for instance one every few hundredths or a few thousandths
of a second, while the cycle of a stationary steam engine lasts about a quarter of
a second.
It is therefore natural that in machines, the advent of the use of informationchannels that are distinct from energy channels caused a very profound change in
the philosophy of technics. This advent was conditioned by the development of the

144

vehicles of information, and in particular of low current signals. This is what we
call electric currents considered not as energy carriers, but as vehicles for informa­
tion. Electric current, as a vehicle for information, is equal only to Hertz waves or a
light beam, which also consists of electromagnetic waves like Hertz waves: because
electric current and electromagnetic waves have in common both an extreme speed
of transmission and the ability to be modulated with precision, without noticeable
inertia, in frequency as well as in amplitude. Their ability to be modulated makes
them faithful carriers of information, and their speed of transmission makes them
rapid carriers. What then becomes important is no longer the power conveyed,
but the accuracy and fidelity o f the modulation transmitted by the information
channel. Beyond the dimensions defined by thermodynamics, a new category of
physical dimensions emerges that makes it possible to classify information chan­
nels and compare them. This elaboration o f new concepts has a particular sense for
philosophical thought because it provides the example of new values which, until
this day, made no sense in technics, though they made sense in human thought
and behavior. Thermodynamics had thus defined the notion of efficiency for a con­
version system such as an engine: the efficiency is the ratio between the amount of
energy at the inlet of the engine and the amount of energy collected at the outlet;
between the inlet and the outlet there is a change in the form of energy; for exam­
ple, in the case o f the heat engine, thermal energy becomes mechanical energy;
since we know the mechanical equivalent of a calorie, we can define the efficiency
of an engine as a transformer o f thermal energy into mechanical energy. In every
device that performs a conversion, we can more generally define an efficiency
that is the ratio between two energies; there is thus the efficiency of the furnace,
which is the ratio between the amount of chemical energy contained in the fuel
system and the amount o f heat actually released; the efficiency of the furnace-boiler
system, defined by the ratio between the caloric energy produced by the furnace
and the thermal energy effectively transmitted to the water in the boiler; there is
an engine efficiency that is the ratio between the energy contained in the system
that is constituted by the hot steam sent to the inlet and by the cold sink in the
condenser, and the mechanical energy effectively produced by the steam expansion
in the cylinder (a theoretical efficiency governed by the Carnot principle). In a
series of energy transformations, the efficiency calculated between the first energy
input and the last energy output is the product of all partial efficiencies. This prin­
ciple applies even where the energy collected in the output is of the same nature as
that at the inlet; when a storage battery is being charged, there is an initial partial
efficiency which is the conversion of electrical energy into chemical energy; when

CURRENT PROBLEMS

145

discharging it, there is a second partial efficiency, which is that o f the conversion of
chemical energy into electrical energy: the output of the battery is the product of
these two efficiencies. However, when an information channel is used to transmit
information, or when information is recorded onto a medium for storage purposes,
or when there is a transfer from one information medium to another medium (for
example from mechanical vibrations to an alternating current in which the fre­
quencies and amplitudes follow the vibrations), a loss of information occurs: what
is collected at the outlet is not identical to what was at the inlet.
For example, if one wants to transmit a current of acoustic frequencies through
an information channel that is a telephonic circuit, one notes that some frequen­
cies are correctly transmitted: for these, the modulation collected at the outlet is
identical to that which was put in at the input o f the circuit. But the bandwidth
of the telephone circuit is narrow; if one enters a noise or a complex sound at the
entrance to this channel a considerable deformation ensues: the modulation col­
lected at the outlet is not at all comparable to that which was entered at the input;
it consists in an impoverishment of the former; for example, the fundamental
frequencies of complex sounds between 200 Hz and 2000 Hz are transmitted cor­
rectly, but deprived of their upper harmonics. Or once again, the circuit introduces
a harmonic distortion, which is to say that a sinusoidal sound that was entered at
the input is no longer represented by a sinusoidal tension at the outlet; despite
their apparent difference, by the way, the two phenomena are the same: a circuit
that introduces a harmonic distortion is an information channel with a narrow
bandwidth that would transmit, without appreciable distortion, a sound that has
the same frequency at the input as that of the harmonic component which appears
at the outlet even though it wasn’t at the input, which is something that can occur
when the circuit has a resonance at this harmonic frequency. A perfect information
channel would provide all the modulations, however rich or complex they may be
at the outlet, as had been put in at the input. One could attribute to this informa­
tion channel an efficiency equal to 1, as one would attribute to a perfect engine.
These efficiency characteristics of information channels are not energy charac­
teristics, and very often good information efficiency goes hand-in-hand with low
energy efficiency: an electromagnetic loudspeaker has better energy efficiency than
an electro-dynamic loudspeaker, but very poor information output. This fact is
fairly well explained if one considers that, in a transformation system, the best
energy efficiency is obtained when there is a tight coupling of two elements by
a sharp resonance; a transformer whose coil capacitances are in tune with a cer­
tain frequency has an excellent primary-secondary coupling for this frequency;

146

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

but it has a poor coupling for the other frequencies: it therefore transmits this fre­
quency selectively, which causes a considerable signal loss when it is being used for
broadband transmission; the energy output of a transformer designed to transmit
information is lower, but constant for a wide frequency band. Energy efficiency and
information output are thus two dimensions that are not linked to each other: the
technician is often obliged to sacrifice one of the two outputs to obtain the other.
Form is what is essential in information channels, and the conditions of its correct
transmission are very different than those of high efficiency energy transmission.
The resolution of problems related to information channels calls for an attitude
that is different in spirit to that which is appropriate for problem solving in applied
thermodynamics.19 A technician of thermodynamics tends toward gigantism in
constructions and large-scale effects, because thermodynamic efficiency increases
with the size of engines and installations. It is certainly possible to construct a
small-scale steam engine, but its efficiency is low; even if it is very well constructed,
it cannot attain an excellent efficiency because heat loss and the importance of
mechanical friction significantly come into play. The turbine is a system for the
transformation of thermal energy into mechanical energy, which offers a better effi­
ciency than that o f a reciprocating engine; but if a turbine is to function properly,
it requires a large installation. The efficiency o f three small thermal power plants is
lower than that of a single power plant with the same power as the three small ones
together. This increase in efficiency with the size of the involved machines is a gen­
eral and practical law o f energetics that exceeds the framework of thermodynamics
strictly speaking; an industrial electric transformer generally has a higher efficiency
than one with a nominal power of 50 watts. However, this tendency is much less
pronounced within new forms of energy, such as electrical energy, than within the
old ones, such as heat; nothing would stand in the way of constructing a small scale
high-output electric transformer; if the efficiency of low power devices is somewhat
neglected, then this is because the loss of output is less important for them than for
industrial devices (heat, in particular, is more easily dissipated, for the same reasons
that a small steam engine has a lower efficiency than a large one).
On the contrary, the information technician is brought in to find the smallest
possible dimensions compatible with the residual thermodynamic requirements of
the devices he uses. Information, effectively, is all the more useful, in a regulation
process, in that it intervenes without delay, since the increase in size o f information
machines or transmission devices increases inertia and transit time. The stylus of
the telegraph has become too heavy; a cable can transmit far more signals than the
19. Or, more generally, in energetics.

CURRENT PROBLEMS

147

stylus can print; a single cable could carry the traffic of thirty simultaneous calls.
In an electronic tube, the time of transit for electrons between cathode and anode
is responsible for a cutoff o f high frequencies; the smallest electronic tube is the
one that can reach the highest frequencies, but this same tube then has a very low
power, because its small size does not allow it to evacuate enough heat without
reaching a temperature that would compromise its functioning. It is possible that
one of the causes of the tendency toward size reduction, which we have witnessed
since 1946, lies in the discovery of this imperative o f information technics: to build
technical individuals and above all elements of a very small size, because they are
more perfect and have better information output.

A philosophy of technics, however, cannot be founded exclusively on an uncon­
ditional quest for form and efficiency of form in the transmission of information.
Yet the two kinds of efficiency, which appear to diverge, and which in fact already
diverge at the very beginning, are once again encountered further on: when the
quantity of energy that serves as a carrier for information tends toward a very low
level, a new type of output loss appears, one that is due to the elementary disconti­
nuity of energy. The energy that serves as information carrier is in fact modulated in
two ways: artificially, by the signal that is to be transmitted; essentially, by virtue of
its physical nature, by the elementary discontinuity. This elementary discontinuity
appears when the average energy level is of an order of magnitude that is barely
superior to instantaneous variations due to the elementary discontinuity of energy;
artificial modulation then conflates itself with this essential modulation, with this
white noise or fog that superimposes itself on the transmission; it is not a question
here of a harmonic distortion, for this is a modulation that is independent from that
of the signal, and not simply a deformation or impoverishment of the signal. Now,
in order to diminish the background noise, one can diminish the bandwidth, which
also diminishes the informational efficiency of the channel under consideration.
A compromise must be struck that preserves an informational efficiency sufficient
for practical needs and an energetic efficiency that is sufficiently high to keep back­
ground noise at a level where it does not trouble the reception of the signal.

148

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

And yet this antagonism, which is barely acknowledged in the recent work going
on in the philosophy o f information technics, marks the non-univocal aspect of
the notion of information. Information is, in a sense, that which can be infinitely
varied, that which, in order to be transmitted with the least possible loss, requires
a sacrifice of energy efficiency so as to avoid any reduction of the range of pos­
sibilities. The most faithful amplifier is the one with a very uniform efficiency
independent of the scale o f frequencies; it favors none of them, imposes no reso­
nance, no stereotypy, no pre-established regularity onto the open series of varied
signals that it must transmit. But information, in another sense, is that which, in
order to be transmitted, must be above the level of pure random phenomena, such
as white noise or thermal agitation; information is then that which possesses a reg­
ularity, a localization, a defined domain, a determined stereotypy through which
information distinguishes itself from pure chance. When the level of background
noise is high, the information signal can still be saved if it has a certain law, in other
words, if it offers a certain predictability of the unfolding of the temporal series of
the successive states that constitute it. In television, for instance, the fact that the
frequency of the timebase is well determined in advance allows for the synchro­
nization timing pips to be extracted from an equally important background noise
by blocking the synchronization devices nine-tenths of the time, and by unblock­
ing them for just a brief instant (for instance, a millionth of a second) when the
synchronization timing pip must set in, by virtue of the previously defined law
o f recurrence (this is the phase comparison device, used for long distance recep­
tions). The reception of synchronization signals, in turn, must indeed be treated
as information. But this information is more easily extracted from background
noise because the perturbing action of the background noise can be limited to
a very small fraction of the total time, thereby rejecting as insignificant all the
manifestations of background noise that fall outside this instant. This device is
of course ineffective against a parasitic signal, which itself obeys a recurrent law
with a period very close to the period intended for signal reception. There are thus
two aspects of information, which distinguish themselves technically through the
opposed conditions necessary for their transmission. In one sense, information is
that which brings about a series of unpredictable, new states, not belonging to any
series that could be defined in advance; it is thus that which requires an absolute
availability of the information channel regarding all the aspects of modulation
that it bears; the information channel itself must not contribute any predeter­
mined form of its own, nor be selective. A perfectly faithful amplifier would have
to be able to transmit all frequencies and amplitudes. In this sense, information has

CURRENT PROBLEMS

149

certain aspects in common with purely contingent, lawless phenomena, such as the
movements of thermal molecular agitation, radioactive emissions, discontinuous
electronic emissions in the thermoelectric or photoelectric effect. This is why a very
faithful amplifier20 has greater background noise than an amplifier with a smaller
bandwidth, because it uniformly amplifies the white noises produced in its diverse
circuits by diverse causes (by thermal effect in the resistances, by discontinuity of
electronic emission in the tubes). Noise, however, has no signification whereas
information has signification. By contrast, information distinguishes itself from
noise because it can be assigned a certain code, a relative uniformization; in any
case where noise cannot be directly reduced below a certain level, a reduction of
the margin of indeterminacy and unpredictability of the information signals is
performed; such is the case, mentioned above, of the reception of synchronization
signals by a phase comparator. What is reduced here, is the margin of temporal
indeterminacy: it is assumed that the signal will produce itself at a certain moment
in a temporal interval equal to a minimal fraction, perfectly determined by its
phase, of the period of the recurrent phenomenon. The device can be tuned all
the more finely as the stability of the transmitter and the stability of the receptor
increase. The greater the predictability of the signal, the easier it is for it to be
distinguished from the chance phenomenon called background noise. The same
holds true for the reduction of the frequency band: when a circuit can no longer
transmit speech, because of a high level o f background noise, one can use a trans­
mission of signals in a single frequency, as is done with Morse code; at reception, a
filter adapted to the unique frequency of transmission only allows for those sounds
to pass whose frequency falls within this narrow band; a low level of background
noise then comes through, all the more reduced as the received band narrows, i.e.,
as the resonance becomes sharper.
This opposition represents a technical antinomy that poses a problem for
philosophical thought: information is like the chance event, but it nevertheless dis­
tinguishes itself from it. An absolute stereotypy, excluding all novelty, also excludes
all information. And yet, in order to distinguish information from noise, one takes
an aspect of the reduction of the limits of indeterminacy as a basis. If the time
bases were truly incorruptible like Leibniz’s monads, then one could reduce the
synchronization time of the oscillator as much as desired; the informing role of the
synchronizing pulse would entirely disappear, because there would be nothing to
synchronize: the synchronization signal would have no aspect o f unpredictability
with respect to the oscillator to be synchronized; in order for the informational

150

nature o f the signal to subsist, a certain margin of indeterminacy must subsist.
Predictability is the ground receiving this supplementary precision, distinguishing
it in advance from pure chance in a great number of cases, partially preforming it.
Information is thus halfway between pure chance and absolute regularity. One can
say that form, conceived as absolute spatial as well as temporal regularity, is not
information but a condition o f information; it is what receives information, the
a p rio ri that receives information. Form has a function of selectivity. But informa­
tion is not form, nor is it a collection \ensemble ] of forms; it is the variability of
forms, the influx of variation with respect to a form. It is the unpredictability of a
variation of form, not pure unpredictability o f all variation. We would thus be led
to distinguish three terms: pure chance, form, and information.
However, to this day, the new phase of the philosophy of technics, which fol­
lowed after the phase that was contemporary with thermodynamics and energetics,
has not made a clear distinction between fo rm and inform ation. There is, in effect,
an important gap between the living thing and the machine, and consequently
between man and machine, which comes from the fact that the living thing needs
information, while the machine essentially uses forms, and is so to speak con­
stituted with forms. Philosophical thought will not be able to grasp the sense of
coupling between man and machine unless it manages to elucidate the true rela­
tion that exists between form and information. The living transforms information
into forms, the a posteriori into a p rio ri ; but this a p rio ri is always oriented toward
the reception of information to be interpreted. The machine on the contrary has
been built according to a certain number of schemas, and it functions in a deter­
minate way; its technicity, its functional concretization at the level of the element
are determinations of forms.
The human individual thus appears as having to convert the forms deposited
into machines into information; the operating of machines does not give rise to
information, but is simply an assemblage and a modification of forms; the func­
tioning of a machine has no sense, and cannot give rise to true information signals
for another machine; a living being is required as mediator in order to interpret a
given functioning in terms o f information, and in order to convert it into the forms
for another machine. Man understands machines; for there to be a true technical
ensemble man has to play a functional role between machines rather than above
them. It is man who discovers significations: signification is the meaning [sens] that
an event takes on with respect to already existing forms; signification is what makes
an event have value as information.

CURRENT PROBLEMS

This function is complementary with the function of the invention of technical
individuals. Man, interpreter of machines, is also the one who has, on the basis
of his schemas, founded the rigid forms that enable the machine to function. The
machine is a deposited fixed human gesture that has become a stereotypy and the
power to restart. A rocker switch with two fixed states* has been thought out and
built once; man represented its functioning to himself a limited number of times,
and now the rocker performs its equilibrium-reversing operation indefinitely. It
perpetuates the human operation that constituted it in a determinate activity; a
certain transition has been carried out, through construction, from a mental to a
physical functioning. There is a veritable and profound dynamic analogy between
the process through which man thought up the rocker switch and the physical
process of functioning of this rocker switch once built. A relation of iso-dynamism
exists between man who invents and the machine that functions, which is more
essential than the Gestalt psychologists had imagined in order to explain percep­
tion, calling it an isomorphism. The analogical relation between machine and man
is not at the level of corporeal functioning; the machine neither nourishes itself
nor perceives, nor rests, and cybernetic literature falsely exploits the appearance of
analogy. The true analogical relation is in fact between the mental functioning of
man and the physical functioning of the machine. These two ways of functioning
are not parallel within everyday life, but rather within invention. To invent is to
make one’s thought function as a machine might function, neither according to
causality, which is too fragmentary, nor according to finality, which is too uni­
tary, but according to the dynamism of lived functioning, grasped because it is
produced, accompanied in its genesis. The machine is a being that functions. Its
mechanisms concretize a coherent dynamism that once existed in thought, which
were that thought. During invention, the dynamism of thought converted itself
into functioning forms. Inversely, the machine, in functioning, is subject to or
produces a certain number of variations around the fundamental rhythms of its
functioning, arising from its definite forms. These variations are what are signifi­
cant, and they are significant with respect to the archetype of functioning, which is
that of thought in the process of invention. One has to have invented or reinvented
the machine if the machines variations of functioning are to become information.
The noise of an engine in itself does not have value as information; it takes on this
value through its variation in rhythm, the change of its frequency or tone, the
alteration of its transients which translate a modification o f its functioning with
respect to the functioning that results from invention. When the correlation that
exists between machines is purely causal, then it isn’t necessary for a human being

152

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

to intervene as the mutual interpreter of the machines. But this role is necessary
when the machines comprise regulation; a machine that has regulation is in effect
a machine that harbors a certain margin of indeterminacy in its functioning; it can,
for instance, go fast or slow. Henceforth, its variations in speed become significant
and can take into account what is happening outside the machine, in the technical
ensemble. The more automatized the machines are, the more restricted its possible
variations in speed are; they can thus go unperceived; but what is happening here
is in fact what is happening for a very stable oscillator that is synchronized by
another even more stable oscillator: the oscillator can continue to receive infor­
mation as long as it is not rigorously stable, and despite the fact that the margin
of indeterminacy o f its functioning is reduced, synchronization still has meaning
[sens] inside this margin o f indeterminacy. The synchronization pulse has meaning
when it intervenes as a very slight variation on this temporal form of recurrence of
the states o f functioning. In the same way, the reduction of the indeterminacy of its
functioning does not isolate the machines from one another; it renders the variation
in signification, which has value as information, more rigorous and refined. But it
is always with respect to the essential schemas of the invention of the machine that
these variations have a sense.
The notion of a perfect automaton is a notion that is obtained by confronting a
limit, and so it harbors something contradictory: the autom aton is supposed, to he a
m achine so perfect th at the m argin o f indeterminacy o f its functioning would be null,
but which w ould be able nevertheless to receive, interpret, or em it information. And yet,

if the margin of indeterminacy of functioning is null, then there is no longer any
possible variation; the functioning repeats indefinitely, and consequently this iter­
ation has no signification. Information is maintained throughout automatization
only because the fineness of the signals increases with the reduction of the margin
of indeterminacy, which means that the signals conserve their signifying value,
even if this margin of indeterminacy becomes extremely narrow. If, for instance,
oscillators are stable to about a thousandth in frequency variation, then the syn­
chronization pulses, whose possible phase-rotation would vary over time at about
ten percent, or which would have no steep incline and a variable duration, would
have only a low informational value for synchronization. To synchronize oscillators
that are already very stable, tiny perfectly cut pulses are used whose phase-angle is
rigorously constant. Information is all the more significant, or rather a signal has all
the more informational value as it acts in concordance with an autonomous form
of the individual who receives it; hence, when the natural frequency of an oscil­
lator that is to be synchronized is far from the frequency of the synchronization

CURRENT PROBLEMS

153

pulses, synchronization does not occur; on the contrary, synchronization occurs for
signals that become weaker as the autonomous frequency and the pulse frequency
get closer to each other. Nevertheless, this relation must be more carefully inter­
preted: for recurrent pulses to synchronize an oscillator, these pulses must arrive
at a critical period of functioning, namely the one which immediately precedes
the reversal of equilibrium, which is to say just before the beginning of a phase;
the synchronizing pulse arrives as a very small additional quantity o f energy that
accelerates the passage to the next phase, at a moment in which this passage was
not yet fully accomplished; the pulse triggers. It is for this reason that the greatest
fineness of the synchronization, the highest sensitivity, is obtained when the auton­
omous frequency would be ever so slightly lower than the synchronizing frequency.
With respect to this form of recurrence, the pulses with a very slight advance take
on a meaning [sens], and carry information. The moment in which the oscillators
equilibrium will be reversed is that in which a metastable state is created, with an
accumulation of energy.
It is this existence of critical phases that explains the difficulty of synchronizing
a way of functioning that does not offer an abrupt reversal of states: a sinusoidal
oscillator synchronizes less easily than a relaxation oscillator*; the margin of inde­
terminacy is effectively less critical in the functioning of a sinusoidal oscillator; its
functioning can be modified at any moment during the course o f its period; in a
relaxation oscillator, on the contrary, indeterminacy is accumulated at each end of
the cycle, rather than being spread over the whole duration o f the cycle; when the
equilibrium is reversed, the relaxation oscillator is no longer sensitive to the pulse it
receives; but when it is on the tipping point, it is extremely sensitive; the sinusoidal
oscillator, on the contrary, is sensitive throughout the phase, but in a mediocre way.
The existence of a margin of indeterminacy in machines must therefore be
understood as the existence of a certain number of critical phases of functioning;
the machine that can receive information is the one that temporarily localizes its
indeterminacy in instants that are sensitive and rich with possibilities. This struc­
ture is one of decision, but it is also that of the relay. The machines that can receive
information are the ones that localize their indeterminacy.
This notion of the localization of decisions within functioning is not absent
from books on cybernetics. But what this study lacks is the notion of the reversibil­
ity of the reception of information and the emission of information. If a machine
presents a functioning with critical phases, such as those o f the relaxation oscillator,
then it can emit information as well as receive it; a relaxation oscillator thus emits
pulses, as a result of its discontinuous functioning, which can serve to synchronize

154

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

another relaxation oscillator. If one couples two relaxation oscillators to each other,
these two oscillators synchronize in such a way that one cannot say which one
synchronizes and which one is synchronized; in fact, they synchronize each other,
and the ensemble functions as a single oscillator, with a single period that is slightly
different from the periods proper to each one of the oscillators.
It can appear too simple to oppose open machines and closed machines, in the
sense Bergson gives these two adjectives.21 And yet this difference is real; the exis­
tence o f a regulation in a machine leaves the machine open insofar as it localizes the
critical periods and the critical points, in other words those on the basis of which
the energetic channels of the machine can be modified, changing characteristics.
The individualization o f the machine goes hand in hand with this separation of
forms and critical elements; a machine can be in relation with the exterior inso­
far as it possesses critical elements; the existence of these critical points in the
machine, in turn, justifies the presence of man: the rate [régim e] of the machine
can be modified by information coming from the outside. A calculating machine
is therefore not only, as one generally says, a set [ensem ble] of rocker switches. It
is true that the calculating machine has a great number of determinate forms, the
forms o f the functioning of the series of rocker switches, representing a series of
operations of additions. But if the machine consisted in this alone, then it would
be useless, because it wouldn’t be capable of receiving any information. In fact, it
also has what one could call the system of schemas o f decisions; before operating
the machine, it has to be program m ed. Even with the multi-vibrator that provides
the pulses and the series of rockers that do the adding, there still wouldn’t be a
calculating machine. It is the existence of a certain degree of indeterminacy that
makes calculation possible: the machine contains a set [ensem ble] of selectors and
of commutations that are commanded by programming. Even in the simplest case,
that of a scale composed of rockers and counting pulses, such as those used after
the Geiger-Müller tube-counters, there is a degree of indeterminacy in its function­
ing; the Geiger tube under voltage is in the same state as a relaxation oscillator at
the instant in which it will start a new phase, or as a multi-vibrator in the instant
in which it will switch by itself. The only difference is that this metastable state
(corresponding to a constant voltage in the Geiger-Müller tube) prolongs itself in
the tube in a durable way until an additional energy triggers ionization, whereas,
in the relation oscillator or multi-vibrator, this state is transitory, as a result of the

Dame Press, 1977). [TN]

continuation of activity in the resistance circuits and the capacitances external to
the electronic tube or thyratron.
This margin of indeterminacy can be found in all the varying types of devices
that can transmit information. A continuous relay, such as a thermo-electronic
or crystalline triode, can transmit information because the existence of potential
energy defined at the limits of the supply circuit is not enough for determining
the quantity of effective and actual energy that is sent into the outlet circuit: this
open relation of possibility in the actualization of an energy is closed only by way
of the additional condition of the arrival of information onto the controller. A
continuous relay can be defined as a transducer, in other words as resistance that
can be modulated by an information that is external to the potential energy and to
the actual energy: this resistance can be modulated by information that is external
to both the potential energy and the real energy. And still the notion of “resistance
that can be modulated” is too vague and inadequate; if this resistance was effectively
a true resistance, it would belong to the domain o f actualization of the potential
energy. Yet, in a perfect transducer, no energy is actualized; nor is any energy put
in reserve: the transducer belongs neither to the domain of potential energy, nor to
the domain of actual energy; it is truly the mediator between these two domains,
but it is neither a domain o f the accumulation of energy, nor a domain of actualiza­
tion: it is a margin of indeterminacy between these two domains, that which brings
potential energy to its actualization. It is during the course of this passage from
potential to actual that information comes into play; information is the condition
of actualization.
This notion of transduction, in turn, can be generalized. Presented in its
purest state in transducers of different kinds, it exists as a regulative function in
all machines having a certain margin of localized indeterminacy in their func­
tioning. The human being, and the living being more generally, are essentially
transducers. The elementary living being, the animal, is itself a transducer when
it stores chemical energies and then actualizes them during the course of different
vital operations. Bergson illuminated this function of the living, which constitutes
energetic potentials and expends them briskly; but Bergson was here concerned
with showing a function of temporary contraction that would be constitutive of
life; the relation, however, between the slowness of accumulation and the instanta­
neous briskness of actualization does not always exist; the living thing can actualize
its potential energy slowly, as in thermal regulation or muscle tonicity; what is
essential is not the difference of temporal operating speeds of potentialization and
actualization, but the fact that the living thing intervenes between potential energy

156

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

and this actual energy as a transducer; the living thing is th at which m odulates, that
in which there is modulation, and not a reservoir of energy or an effector. Nor is
it enough to say: the living assimilates; assimilation is a source of potential energy
that can be liberated and actualized in the functions of transduction.
Mans relation with machines takes place at the level of the functions of trans­
duction. It is in fact very easy to construct machines that ensure a much greater
accumulation of energy compared to that which man can accumulate in his body;
it is equally possible to use artificial systems that constitute effectors that are supe­
rior to those of the human body. But it is very difficult to construct transducers
comparable to the living thing. Indeed the living thing is not exactly a transducer
like those that can be found in machines; it is that and something more; mechan­
ical transducers are systems with a margin of indeterminacy; information is that
which adds determinacy. But this information must be given to the transducer;
it cannot invent it; it is given to it by a mechanism that is analogous to that of
perception in the living, for instance by a signal coming from the manner in which
the effector functions (the gauge on the output shaft of a heat engine). On the
contrary, the living thing has the capacity to give itself information, even in the
absence of all perception, because it possesses the capacity to modify the forms of
the problems to be resolved; for the machine, there are no problems, only data that
modulate the transducers; several transducers that act upon one another according
to commutable schemas, such as Ashby’s homeostat, do not constitute a problem
solving machine: the transducers in a reciprocal relation of causality are all w ithin
the sam e tim e\ they condition one another in actuality [dans I ’actueH; they are never
confronted with a problem, something thrown down before them, something that
is in front o f them and that they will have to step or leap over. To solve a problem
is to be able to step over it, to be capable of recasting the forms that are given
within the problem and in which it consists. The solution of real problems is a vital
function presupposing a recurrent mode o f action that cannot exist in the machine:
the recurrence of the future with respect to the present, of the virtual with respect
to the actual. There is no true virtuality in a machine; the machine cannot reform
its forms in order to solve a problem. When Ashbys homeostat switches by itself
during the course of its functioning (for one can attribute to this machine the
faculty of acting on its own selectors), a jump in characteristics that eliminates all
prior functioning occurs; at each instant the machine exists in actuality, and the
faculty to apparently change its forms is not very efficient, because nothing is left
of the previous forms; it all happens as if there were a new machine; each operation
is momentary; when the machine changes form by switching, it does not switch

CURRENT PROBLEMS

157

in order to have this other form oriented toward solving the problem; there is no
modification of forms that would be oriented by the presentiment of a problem to
be resolved; the virtual does not act upon the actual, because the virtual, insofar as
it is virtual, cannot play a role for the machine. It can only react to something that
is positively given, actually done. The living thing has the faculty to modify itself
according to the virtual: this faculty is the sense o f time, which the machine does
not have because it does not live.
Technical ensembles are characterized by the fact that in them a relation between
technical objects takes shape at the level of the margin of indeterminacy of each
technical objects way of functioning. This relation between technical objects is of
a problematic type, insofar as it puts indeterminacies into correlation, and for this
reason it cannot be taken on by the objects themselves; it cannot be calculated, nor
be the result of a calculation; it must be thought, posed as a problem by a living
being and for a living being. One could express what we have called a coupling
between man and machine by saying that man is responsible for machines. This
responsibility is not that o f the producer insofar as the produced thing comes from
him, but that of a third party, a witness to a difficulty that only he can resolve
because he alone has the power to think; man is the witness to the machines and
represents them in relation to one another; machines can neither think nor experi­
ence [vivre] their mutual relation; they can only act upon one another in actuality,
according to causal schemas. Man as witness to machines is responsible for their
relation; the individual machine represents man, but man represents the ensemble
of machines, for there is not one machine of all machines, whereas there can be a
thought that encompasses all machines.
One can call a technological attitude that which compels man to look after not
only the utilization o f a technical being, but after the correlation of technical beings
among each other. The current opposition between culture and technics comes
from the fact that the technical object is considered identical with the machine.
Culture does not understand the machine; it is inadequate to technical reality
because it considers the machine to be a closed block, and considers mechanical
functioning to be an iterative stereotypy. The opposition between technics and cul­
ture will last until culture discovers that each machine is not an absolute unit, but
only an individualized technical reality that is open according to two paths: that
of the relation to elements, and that of the inter-individual relations within the
technical ensemble. The role culture has assigned to man alongside the machine
is at odds with technical reality; it assumes that the machine is substantialized,
materialized, and consequently devalued; the machine is in fact less consistent and

158

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

less substantial than culture assumes; it does not relate to man as a single block, but
through the free plurality of its elements, or the open series of its possible relations
with other machines within the technical ensemble. Culture is unjust toward the
machine, not only in its judgments or its preconceptions, but at the very level of
knowledge: the cognitive intention of culture toward the machine is substantializ­
ing; the machine is closed up in this reductive vision that considers it to be perfect
and finished in itself, that makes it coincide with its actual state, with its material
determinations. With respect to the art object, such an attitude would consist in
reducing a painting to a certain expanse of dried and cracked paint on a stretched
canvas. In regard to the human being, the same attitude would consist in reducing
the subject to a fixed set o f vices and virtues, or character traits.22
To reduce art to art objects, to reduce humanity to a series of individuals that
are mere carriers o f character traits, is to act as one does when reducing technical
reality to a collection of machines: yet, in the first two cases, this attitude is judged
crude, in the second case, it passes for being in conformity with the values of
culture, although it operates with the same destructive reduction as it does in the
first two cases. Except that it operates by making an implicit judgment through
knowledge itself. It is the very notion of the machine that is already distorted, like
the representation o f the foreigner [étranger] in group stereotypies.
However, it is not the foreigner as foreigner who can become the object of
cultured thought, but only the human being. The stereotype of the foreigner
cannot be transformed into a just and adequate representation unless the relation
between the being who judges and the one who is the foreigner is diversified and is
multiplied in order to acquire a multiform mobility that confers upon it a certain
consistency, a definite power of reality. A stereotype is a two-dimensional repre­
sentation, like an image, without depth and without plasticity. For the stereotype
to become a representation, the experiences of the relationship with the foreigner
must be multiple and varied. The foreigner is no longer foreign, but other, when
there are foreign beings not only with respect to the subject who judges, but also
with respect to other foreigners; the stereotype falls away when this relation of man
to the foreign is known in its entirety between other people, rather than enclosing
the subject and the foreigner within an asymmetrical, immutable mutual situation.
In the same manner, the stereotypes relating to the machine cannot change unless
the relation between man and machine (an asymmetrical relation for as long as it
is lived as an exclusive relation) can be seen objectively in the process of producing
itself between terms that are independent of the subject, between technical objects.
22. This reductive attitude can also exist toward an entire region (regionalism).

CURRENT PROBLEMS

159

In order for the representation of technical contents to be incorporated into cul­
ture, an objectivation of the technical relation must exist for man.
The predominant and exclusive attention to a machine cannot lead to the dis­
covery of technicity, any more than the relation with a single sort o f stranger or
foreigner can allow one to penetrate the interiority of their way of life, and to know
it according to culture. Even interaction with several machines is not enough, any
more than successive interactions with several foreigners; these experiences only
lead to xenophobia or to xenophilia, which are opposite but equally passionate
attitudes. In order to consider a foreigner through culture, one needs to have objec­
tively seen the relation whereby two beings are foreigners to one another play out.
Likewise, if a single technics does not suffice to offer cultural content, neither does
a polytechnics; it merely engenders the tendency toward technocracy or the refusal
of technics as a whole.
IV - P hilosophical thought m ust carry ou t the integration o f tech n ical reality into
universal culture, by fo u n d in g a technology

The advent of the conditions allowing man to see the technical relation functioning
in an objective way is the prime condition for the incorporation o f the knowledge
of technical reality and of the values implied by its existence into culture. Now,
these conditions are realized in the technical ensembles employing machines that
have a sufficient degree of indeterminacy. For man, the action of having to inter­
vene as a mediator in this relation between machines grants him a situation of
independence in which he can acquire a cultural vision of technical realities. The
engagement in the asymmetrical relation with a single machine cannot provide the
necessary distance for what one might call technical wisdom. Only a situation in
which there is a concrete link with machines and a responsibility toward them, but
which is liberated vis-à-vis each one taken individually, can provide this serenity
of having technical awareness. Just as literary culture, in order to constitute itself,
needed the wise individuals who had lived and contemplated the inter-human
relation with a certain distance that gave them a serenity and a depth of judgment
while nevertheless maintaining an intense presence among human beings, techni­
cal culture cannot constitute itself without developing a certain sort of wisdom,
which we will call technical wisdom, in men who feel their responsibility toward
technical realities, but who remain disengaged from the immediate and exclusive

160

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

relationship with a particular technical object. It is rather difficult for a worker23 to
know technicity through the aspects and modalities o f his daily work on a machine.
It is also difficult for a man who is the owner of machines and who considers them
productive capital to know their essential technicity. It is the mediator of the rela­
tion between machines alone who can discover this particular form of wisdom.
Such a function, however, does not yet have a social place; it would be that of the
production planning engineer if he wasn’t preoccupied by immediate output, and
governed by a finality external to the operating system [régime] of machines which
is that of productivity. The function whose basic lines we are attempting to draw
would be that of a psychologist of machines, or of a sociologist of machines —
what we might call a mechanologist.
A sketch of this role can be found in Norbert Wieners founding intention for
cybernetics, this science o f command and communication in the living being and
the machine. The meaning of cybernetics has been poorly understood, for this
eminently new endeavor has been reduced and judged according to old notions or
tendencies. In France, cybernetic research, which makes the assumption that there
is a unity between information theory and the study of command schemas and
self-regulation, has split into two divergent branches, that of information theory
with Louis de Broglie and the team publishing its work in the journal Revue d ’Optiqu e , and that of researchers on automatism, with engineers like Albert Ducrocq,
representing the technicist and technocratic tendencies. But it is the connection
between these two tendencies that would enable the discovery of the values implied
in technical realities and their incorporation into culture. Information theory is
indeed of a scientific order: it employs operational modes close to those employed
by thermodynamic theory. Ducrocq’s technicism, on the contrary, seeks within the
functioning of automatic machines the example of a certain number of functions
that allow one to interpret other types of realities by analogy with automatism.
In particular, the theory of the mechanisms of self-regulation allows us to sketch
a hypothesis for explaining the origins o f life. Or else it is the principal mental
operations, or certain nervous functions that are explained by analogy in this way.
Similar analogies, even when they are not arbitrary, in fact merely indicate that there
are ways of functioning that are in common to both living things and machines.
They leave the problem of nature itself and of its ways of functioning untouched:
this technicism is a phenomenology rather than a deepening of the search for the
nature of the schemas and conditions that govern their implementation.
23. The neutral term operator would be appropriate.

CURRENT PROBLEMS

161

It is of course possible not to accept the way Norbert Wiener characterizes infor­
mation, and the essential postulate of his book, which consists in affirming that
information is opposed to background noise in the same way that negative entropy
is opposed to entropy as defined by thermodynamics. However, even if this oppo­
sition of a divergent determinism to a convergent determinism does not account
for all of technical reality and its relation with life, this opposition contains within
itself an entire method for the discovery and for the definition of a set of values
that are implied in technical ways of functioning and in the concepts by means of
which one can think them. But it is possible to prolong Norbert Wieners reflec­
tion. At the end of his book, the author wonders how the concepts he has defined
might be used for the organization of society. Norbert Wiener observes that large
groups contain less information than small groups, and he explains this fact by
the tendency of the human elements that are the least “homeostatic” to occupy
leading functions in large groups; according to Norbert Wiener, the quantity of
information contained in a group would be, on the contrary, proportionate to
the degree of perfection of the groups homeostasis. The fundamental moral and
political problem would then consist in asking oneself how one can put individuals
representing homeostatic functions at the heads o f groups. But Norbert Wiener
claims that none of the individuals who understand the value of homeostasis and
who also understand information are capable o f taking power; and all the cyber­
neticians together are confronted with men who preside over collective destinies,
like mice that want to hang a bell around the cats neck ( Cybernetics24). The forays
made by the author among trade union leaders filled him with a bitterness that
calls to mind Plato describing his disappointments in his Seventh Letter. And yet,
one can try to find a very different mediation between the understanding of tech­
nics and the force that governs human groups from the one Wiener contemplates.
For it is difficult to make philosophers kings and kings philosophers. It often hap­
pens that philosophers who have become kings cease to be philosophers. The true
mediation between technics and power cannot be individual. It can be realized
only through the mediation of culture. For there is something that allows man to
govern: the culture he has received; it is this culture that gives him significations
and values; it is culture that governs man, even if this man in turn governs other
men and machines. Now, this culture is elaborated by the great mass of those who
are governed; to the extent that the power exerted by a man does not strictly speak­
ing come from himself, but crystallizes and concretizes in him; it comes from the
24. Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics: or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (Cambridge, MA: M IT
Press, 1948), 162.

162

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

governed men and it returns there. There is a sort of recurrence there.
In a time when the development of technics was poor, the elaboration of culture
by governed men was enough for the government to think the problems of the
group as a whole: because it went from human group to human group via the
government, the recurrence o f causality and information was complete and accom­
plished. But this is no longer true: the basis o f culture is still exclusively human; it
is elaborated by the group of men; however, having gone through government, it
returns and applies itself to the human group on the one hand and to machines on
the other: machines are ruled by a culture that has not been elaborated according
to them, and from which they are absent; this culture is inadequate for them and
does not represent them. If the totality o f reality escapes the man who governs,
then this is because the basis o f this reality is still exclusively human. It is culture
that is regulative and in which the circular link o f causality between governing and
governed consists: its starting point and its fulfillment are the governed. The lack
o f social homeostasis comes from the fact that there is an aspect of governed reality
that is not represented in this regulating relation that is culture.
Therefore, the task of the technologist is to be the representative of the tech­
nical beings whereby culture is elaborated: writers, artists, and, very generally,
those called cynosures in psycho-sociology. This is not about mechanizing soci­
ety, through the integration o f an adequate representation of technical realities
to culture. There is no reason to consider society as an unconditional domain of
homeostasis. Norbert Wiener appears to admit a postulate of values that is unnec­
essary, which is to say that a good homeostatic regulation is the ultimate purpose of
societies, and the ideal that must animate every act of government. In fact, just as
the living [le vivant] is grounded in homeostases so as to develop itself and to con­
tinue its coming-into-being, rather than remaining perpetually in the same state,
so too in the act of government there is a force of absolute advent, which is based
on homeostases, but which surpasses them and makes use o f them. The integration
of a representation of technical realities into culture, through an elevation and
enlargement o f the technical domain, must put the problems of finality in their
place, as technical problems, which are wrongly considered ethical and sometimes
religious problems. The incompleteness of technics sacralizes problems of finality
and enslaves men with respect to ends that he represents to himself as absolutes.
For this reason, it is not only technical objects that need to be known at the level
of what they currently are, but the technicity of these objects as a mode of relation
of man with the world among other modes such as the religious and the aesthetic.
Taken on its own, technicity tends to become domineering and to answer each and

CURRENT PROBLEMS

163

every problem, as it does today through the system of cybernetics. In fact, in order
for it to be accurately known, according to its essence, and rightly integrated into
culture, technicity must be known in its relation with the other modes of mans
being in the world. No inductive study, starting from the plurality o f technical
objects, can discover the essence of technicity: it is therefore a direct examination
of technicity according to a genetic method that must be attempted, by employing
a philosophical method.

PART III

T he Essence
of T echnicity

The existence of technical objects and the conditions of their genesis pose a question
for philosophical thought which it cannot resolve through the simple consider­
ation of technical objects themselves: what is the sense o f the genesis of technical
objects with respect to the whole of thought, of man’s existence, and of his manner
of being in the world? The fact that there is an organic aspect of thought and of
the mode of being in the world obliges one to assume that the genesis of technical
objects has repercussions on other human productions, on the attitude man has
toward the world. But this is only a lateral and very imperfect way of posing the
problem that the manifestation of technical objects leads us to confront, as a reality
that is subject to genesis and whose genuine essence resides only in the lines of this
genesis. Indeed, nothing proves what we have here is an independent reality, which
is to say the technical object taken as a definite mode of existence.
If the mode of existence is definite because it derives from a genesis, then this
genesis that engenders objects is perhaps not only the genesis o f objects, or even the
genesis of technical reality: perhaps it originates even further back and constitutes a
limited aspect of a larger process, and continues perhaps to engender other realities
after having led to the appearance of technical objects. It is thus the genesis of all
of technicity that needs to be understood, that of objects and that of non-objectified realities, and the entire genesis implicating man and the world, of which
the genesis of technicity is perhaps only a small part, shouldered and balanced by
other geneses, that are prior, posterior or contemporary, and correlative with that
of technical objects.

168

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

We therefore need to move toward a generalized genetic interpretation of the
relation between man and the world in order to grasp the philosophical impor­
tance of the existence of technical objects.
The very notion of genesis, however, deserves to be made more precise: the word
genesis is taken here in the sense defined in the study on In dividuation in the Light
o f the N otions o f Form a n d o f Inform ation, as the process of individuation in its gen­
erality. There is genesis when the coming-into-being of a system of a primitively
oversaturated reality, rich in potential, greater than unity and harboring an internal
incompatibility, constitutes for this system the discovery of compatibility, a resolution
through the advent of structure. This structuration is the advent of an organization
that is the basis of an equilibrium of metastability. Such genesis opposes itself to the
degradation of the potential energies contained in a system through the passage to a
stable state from which transformation is no longer possible.
The general hypothesis we are making about the sense of the coming-into-being of mans relation with the world consists in considering the whole [>l’ensemble]
formed by man and the world as a system. This hypothesis, however, is not lim­
ited to the affirmation that man and the world form a vital system, comprising
the living thing and its milieu; evolution could indeed be considered an adapta­
tion, i.e., a quest for a stable equilibrium of the system through a reduction of the
gap between the living thing and the milieu. The notion of adaptation, however,
together with the notion of function and of functional finality to which it is linked,
would lead us to see the coming-into-being of the relation between man and the
world as tending toward a state of stable equilibrium, which does not appear to
be correct in mans case, perhaps no more than it is for any living being. If one
wanted to preserve a vitalist foundation for this hypothesis of genetic coming-intobeing, then one could call upon the notion of élan v ita l presented by Bergson. And
indeed, this notion is excellent for demonstrating what is lacking in the notion of
adaptation in order for it to enable an interpretation of the coming-into-being of
life [devenir v ita l], but it is not compatible with it, and an antagonism without pos­
sible mediation subsists between adaptation and the élan vital. It seems that these
two opposed notions, as the couple they form, can be replaced, by the notion of
the individuation of oversaturated systems, conceived as successive resolutions of
tensions through the discovery of structures at the heart of a system rich in poten­
tial. Tensions and tendencies can be conceived as really existing in a system: the
potential is one of the forms of the real, as completely as the actual. The potentials
of a system constitute its power of coming-into-being without degradation; they
are not the simple virtuality of future states, but a reality that pushes them into

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

169

being. Coming-into-being is not the actualization of a virtuality or the result of a
conflict between actual realities, but the operation o f a system with potentials in its
reality: coming-into-being is a series of spurts of structurations of a system, or of
successive individuations of a system.
The relation of man to the world is not a simple adaptation, governed by a
law of self-regulating finality that would find ever increasingly stable states of
equilibrium; on the contrary, the evolution of this relation, in which technicity
participates among other modes o f being, manifests an ability to evolve that grows
at each stage, discovering new forms and forces capable of making it evolve even
more, rather than stabilizing it and making it tend toward more and more limited
fluctuations; the very notion of finality, applied to this coming-into-being, appears
inadequate, since one can indeed find limited finalities within this coming-intobeing (search for food, defense against destructive forces), but there is no unique
and superior end that one could superimpose on all aspects o f evolution in order
to coordinate them and account for their orientation through the search for an end
that would be superior to all particular ends.
This is why it is not forbidden to call upon a hypothesis that intervenes with a
more primitive genetic schema than that of the opposed aspects of adaptation and
élan v ital, and enclosing both of them as abstract limit cases: namely that of the
successive stages of an individuating structuration, going from metastable state to
metastable state by means of successive inventions of structures.
The technicity that manifests itself in the use of objects can perhaps be conceived
as appearing in a structuration that provisionally resolves the problems posed by
the primitive and original phase of man’s relationship to the world. One can call
this first phase the m agical ph ase , taking this word in its most general sense, and
considering the magical mode of existence as the pre-technical and pre-religious
mode, and so as immediately above the relationship that is simply between the
living thing and its milieu. The magical mode of the relation with the world is
not devoid of all organization: on the contrary, it is rich in implicit organization,
attached to the world and to man; in the magical mode the mediation between man
and the world is not yet concretized and constituted as standing apart, by means
of specialized objects or human beings, but this mediation does exist function­
ally in the most elementary of all structurations, which is also the first: that from
which erupts the distinction between figure and ground in the universe. Technicity
appears as a structure that resolves an incompatibility: it specializes the figurai
functions, while religions on their side specialize the functions of ground; the origi­
nal magical universe, which is rich in potentials, structures itself by splitting in two.

170

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Technicity appears as one of the two aspects of a solution given to the problem of
mans relation with the world, the other simultaneous and correlated aspect being
the institution of definite religions. However, coming-into-being does not stop at
the discovery o f technicity: from being a solution, technicity once more becomes a
problem when it reconstitutes a system via an evolution that leads from technical
objects to technical ensembles: the technical universe is saturated then over-satu­
rated in turn, at the same time as the religious universe, just as had happened with
the magical universe. The inherence o f technicity to technical objects is provisional;
it constitutes only a moment of genetic coming-into-being.
Now, according to this hypothesis, technicity must never be considered an iso­
lated reality, but as part of a system. It is a partial reality and a transitory reality,
both the result and principle of genesis. Being the result o f an evolution, technicity
is also the depositary of a capacity to evolve, precisely because, as solution to a first
problem, it has the capacity to be a mediation between man and the world.
This hypothesis would entail two consequences: first, the technicity of objects
or of thought cannot be considered as a complete reality or as a mode of thinking
having its own independent truth; any form of thought or any mode of existence
engendered by technicity would need to be complemented and balanced out by
another mode of thought or existence coming from the religious world.
Secondly, as the emergence of technicity marks a break within and a splitting in
two of the primitive magical unity, technicity, like religiosity, is heir to a capacity
for evolutionary divergence; in the coming-into-being of mans mode of being in
the world, this force o f divergence must be compensated by a force of convergence,
by a relational function maintaining unity despite this divergence; the splitting of
the magical structure wouldn’t be viable unless a function of convergence stood in
opposition to the powers of divergence.
These two reasons make it necessary to study where technicity comes from,
what it results in, and what relations it maintains with man’s other modes of being,
which is to say how it opens itself to functions of convergence.
Now, the general sense of coming-into-being would be the following: the dif­
ferent forms of thinking and of being in the world diverge as soon as they appear,
i.e., when they are not saturated; then they re-converge when they are saturated
and tend to structure themselves through new splits. The functions of convergence
can take place by virtue of the over-saturation of the evolutionary forms of being
in the world, at the spontaneous level of aesthetic thought and at the reflected level
of philosophical thought.

EVOLUTION OF TECHNICAL REALITY

171

Technicity becomes oversaturated by once again incorporating the reality o f the
world to which it is applied; religiosity, on the other hand, becomes oversaturated
by incorporating the reality of human groups whose primitive relation with the
world it mediates. Thus oversaturated, technicity splits into theory and praxis, in
the same way that religiosity splits into ethics and dogma.
Thus, there would not only be a genesis of technicity, but also a genesis on
the basis of technicity, through the splitting of an original technicity into figure
and ground [fond], the ground corresponding to the functions of totality that are
independent of each application of technical gestures, whereas the figure, made
of definite and particular schemas, specifies each technique as a manner of acting.
The deepest reality [réalité de fo n d \ of technics constitutes theoretical knowledge,
whereas the particular schemas give us praxis. It is the figurai realities o f religions
which, on the contrary, constitute themselves as a coherent dogma, while the
grounding reality [réalité de fon d ] becomes ethical, and detached from dogma;
there is an analogy to be found between the praxis that issues forth from technics
and the ethics issuing forth from religions, as well as an analogy between the the­
oretical knowledge of the sciences, which issues forth from technics, and religious
dogma; this analogy comes both from the identity o f the representative aspect [of
both scientific knowledge and religious dogma] or the active aspect [of the praxis
of both technics and ethics], and also from the incompatibility that arises from the
fact that these different modes of thinking issue forth either from figurai realities,
or from grounding realities. The purpose [sens] o f philosophical thought, interven­
ing between the two representative orders and the two active orders of thought, is
to make them converge and establish a mediation between them. Now, in order
for this mediation to be possible, the very genesis of these forms of thought must
be known and accomplished in a complete manner on the basis of previous stages
of technicity and religiosity; therefore, philosophical thought must start from the
genesis of technicity, integrated into the ensemble of genetic processes that precede
it, follow and surround it, not only in order to be able to know technicity in itself,
but in order to grasp the problems that dominate the philosophical problematic at
their very basis: the theory of knowledge and the theory of action, in their relation
with the theory of being.

CHAPTER ONE
T he g e n e s i s

of

technicity

/. - The notion o f the ph ase ap p lied to com ing-into-heing: technicity a s a ph ase .
This study postulates that technicity is one of the two fundamental phases o f the
mode of existence of the whole constituted by man and the world. By phase, we
mean not a temporal moment replaced by another, but an aspect that results from a
splitting in two of being and in opposition to another aspect; this sense o f the word
phase is inspired by the notion of a phase ratio in physics; one cannot conceive
of a phase except in relation to another or to several other phases; in a system of
phases there is a relation of equilibrium and of reciprocal tensions; it is the actual
system of all phases taken together that is the complete reality, not each phase in
itself; a phase is only a phase in relation to others, from which it distinguishes itself
in a manner that is totally independent of the notions of genus and species. The
existence of a plurality of phases finally defines the reality of a neutral center of
equilibrium in relation to which there is a phase shift. This schema is very different
from the dialectical schema, because it implies neither necessary succession, nor the
intervention of negativity as a motor of progress; furthermore, opposition, within
the schema of phases, only exists in the particular case of a two-phased structure.
The adoption of such a schema founded upon the notion of the phase aims to
put into play a principle according to which the temporal development of a living
reality proceeds through a split on the basis o f an initial, active center, then through
a regrouping after the furtherance o f each separated reality resulting from this split;
each separated reality is the symbol of the other, just as each phase is the symbol of

174

the other phase or phases; no phase, as a phase, is balanced with respect to itself,
nor does it contain a complete truth or reality: every phase is abstract and partial,
untenable; only the system of phases is in equilibrium in its neutral point; its truth
and its reality are this neutral point, the procession and conversion in relation to
this neutral point.
We suppose that technicity results from a phase shift of a unique, central, and
original mode of being in the world: the magical mode; the phase that balances
out technicity is the religious mode of being. Aesthetic thought appears at the
neutral point, between technics and religion, at the moment of the splitting of the
primitive magical unity: it is not a phase, but rather a permanent reminder of the
rupture of unity of the magical mode of being, as well as a reminder of the search
for its future unity.
Each phase in turn splits into a theoretical mode and a practical mode; there
is thus a practical mode o f technics and a practical mode of religion, as well as a
theoretical mode of technics and a theoretical mode of religion.
In the same way as the distance between technics and religion gives rise to aes­
thetic thought, the distance between the two theoretical modes (the technical one
and the religious one) gives rise to scientific knowledge, as a mediation between
technics and religion. The distance between the practical technical mode and the
practical religious mode gives rise to ethical thinking. Aesthetic thought is thus a
more primitive mediation between technics and religion than science and ethics,
since the birth of science and of ethics requires a prior splitting between the theo­
retical and the practical mode at the heart of technics and of religion. Out of this
arises the fact that aesthetic thought is indeed really situated at the neutral point,
prolonging the existence of magic, whereas science on the one hand and ethics on
the other oppose each other with respect to the neutral point, since there is the
same distance between them as there is between the theoretical and practical mode
in technics and religion. If science and ethics could converge and reunite, they
would coincide within the axis of neutrality of this genetic system, thereby pro­
viding a second analog to the magical unity, above and beyond aesthetic thought,
which is its first analog, and which is incomplete since it allows for the phase shift
of technics and religion to subsist. This second analog would be complete; it would
at once replace magic and aesthetics; but it is perhaps nothing more than a mere
tendency playing a normative role, since nothing proves that the distance between
the theoretical mode and the practical mode can be completely overcome: this
direction defines philosophical research.

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

175

In order to indicate the true nature of technical objects, it is thus necessary to
resort to a study of the entire genesis of the relations of man and the world; the
technicity of objects will then appear as one of two phases of mans relation with
the world engendered by the splitting of the primitive magical unity. Must one
then consider technicity as a simple moment of genesis? — Yes, in a certain sense,
there is indeed something transitory in technicity, which itself splits into theory
and praxis and participates in the subsequent genesis of practical and theoretical
thought. But in another sense, there is something definitive in the opposition of
technicity to religiosity, for one can think that man’s primitive way of being in the
world (magic) can inexhaustibly furnish an indefinite number of successive con­
tributions capable of splitting into a technical phase and a religious phase; in this
way, even though there is effectively a succession in genesis, the successive stages
of different geneses are simultaneous within culture, and there exist relations and
interactions not only between simultaneous phases, but also between successive
stages; not only can technics encounter religion and aesthetic thought, but also
science and ethics. Now, if one adopts the genetic postulate, one notices that a
science or an ethics can never encounter a religion or a technics on a truly common
ground, since the modes of thought are at different levels (for example a science
and a technics) and exist at the same time, and they neither constitute a single
genetic lineage nor arise from the same sudden outpouring o f the primitive magical
universe. True and balanced relations only exist between phases of the same level
(for example between a technical ensemble and a religion) or between successive
degrees of genesis that are part of the same lineage (for example between the stage
of technics and religions in the seventeenth century and the contemporary stages of
science and ethics). True relations only exist in a genetic ensemble balanced around
a neutral point, envisioned in its totality.
This is precisely the goal to be attained: the mission of reflexive thought is to lift
upright and perfect the successive waves of genesis through which the primitive
unity of man’s relation with the world splits in two and comes to sustain both
science and ethics through technics and religion, between which aesthetic thought
develops. In these successive splits, the primitive unity would be lost if science and
ethics could not come back together at the end of genesis; philosophical thinking
inserts itself between theoretical thought and practical thought by way of an exten­
sion of both aesthetic thought and the original magical unity.
Now, in order for the unity of scientific knowledge and ethics to be possible
in philosophical thought, the sources of science and ethics must be at the same
level, contemporary to each other, and have arrived at the same point of genetic

176

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

development. The genesis o f technics and of religion conditions that of science and
o f ethics. Philosophy is itself its own condition, for as soon as reflexive thinking
has begun, it has the power to perfect whichever of the geneses that has not fully
accomplished itself by becoming aware of the sense [sens] of the genetic process
itself. Hence, in order to be able to pose the philosophical problem of the relations
between knowledge and ethics in a profound way, one would first have to complete
the genesis of technics and the genesis o f religious thought, or at the very least (for
this task would be infinite) to know the real direction [sens] of these two geneses.

IL — The p h ase sh ift fro m the p rim itiv e m agical unity

It is therefore necessary to begin with the primitive magical unity of the relations
of man and the world in order to understand the true relation of technics to the
other functions of human thought; it is through this examination that it is possible
to grasp why philosophical thought must realize the integration of the reality of
technics into culture, which is possible only by revealing the sense of the genesis of
technics, through the foundation o f a technology; it is only then that the dispar­
ity between technics and religion will be attenuated, which is detrimental to the
intention o f a reflexive synthesis o f knowledge and ethics. Philosophy must found
technology, which is the ecumenism of technics, for the sciences and ethics to be
able to meet in reflection, a unity o f technics and a unity o f religious thought must
precede the splitting of each of these forms of thought into a theoretical mode and
a practical mode.
The genesis of a particular phase can be described in itself; but it cannot really be
known along with its sense, and consequently grasped in its postulation of unity,
unless it is placed back into the totality of the genesis, as a phase in relation with
other phases. This is why it is insufficient, for understanding technics, to start from
constituted technical objects; objects appear at a certain moment, but technicity
precedes them and goes beyond them; technical objects result from an objectiva­
tion of technicity; they are produced by it, but technicity does not exhaust itself in
the objects and is not entirely contained within them.
If we eliminate the idea of a dialectical relation between successive stages of the
relation of man and the world, then what could be the motor of the successive
splits in the course of which technicity appears? It is possible to appeal to Gestalt
theory, and to generalize the relation it establishes between figure and ground.
Gestalt theory derives its basic principle from the hylomorphic schema of ancient

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

177

philosophy, supported by modern considerations of physical morphogenesis: the
structuration of a system would depend on spontaneous modifications tending
toward a state of stable equilibrium. However, in reality it seems that it would
be necessary to distinguish between a stable equilibrium and a metastable equi­
librium. The emergence of the distinction between figure and ground is indeed
the result of a state of tension, of the incompatibility of the system with itself,
from what one could call the oversaturation of the system; but structuration is not
the discovery of the lowest level of equilibrium: stable equilibrium, in which all
potential would be actualized, would correspond to the death o f any possibility
of further transformation; whereas living systems, those which precisely manifest
the greatest spontaneity of organization, are systems of metastable equilibrium;
the discovery of a structure is indeed at the very least a provisional resolution of
incompatibilities, but it is not the destruction o f potentials; the system continues
to live and evolve; it is not degraded by the emergence o f structure; it remains
under tension and capable of modifying itself.
If one agrees to accept this corrective and replaces the notion o f stability with
that of metastability, it seems that Gestalt theory can account for the fundamental
stages of the coming-into-being of the relation between man and the world.
Primitive magical unity is the relation of the vital connection between man
and the world, defining a universe that is at once subjective and objective prior
to any distinction between the object and the subject, and consequently prior to
any appearance of the separate object. One can conceive of the primitive mode
of mans relation to the world as prior not only to the objectivation of the world,
but even to the segregation of objective units in the field that will be the objec­
tive field. Man finds himself linked to a universe experienced as a milieu. The
emergence of the object only occurs through the isolation and fragmentation of
the mediation between man and the world; and, according to the posited princi­
ple, this objectivation of a mediation must have as correlative, with respect to the
primitive neutral center, the subjectivation of a mediation; the mediation between
man and the world is objectivized as technical object just as it is subjectivized as
religious mediator; but this objectivation and subjectivation, which are opposition
and complementarity, are preceded by an initial relation to the world, the magical
stage, in which the mediation is not yet either subjectivized or objectivized, nor
fragmented or universalized, and is only the simplest and most fundamental of
structurations of the milieu of a living being: the birth of a network of privileged
points of exchange between the being and the milieu.

178

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

The magical universe is already structured, but according to a mode prior to
the segregation of object and subject; this primitive mode of structuration is one
that distinguishes figure and ground by marking key-points in the universe. If the
universe were devoid of all structure, then the relation between the living being
and its milieu could take place in a continuous time and a continuous space, with­
out any privileged moment or place. In fact, preceding the segregation of units,
a reticulation of space and time that highlights privileged places and moments
institutes itself, as if all of mans power to act and all the world s ability to influence
man were concentrated in these places and in these moments. These places and
these moments keep hold of, concentrate, and express the forces contained in the
ground \fond\ of reality that supports them. These points and these moments are
not separate realities; they draw their force from the ground they dominate; but
they localize and focalize the attitude of the living vis-à-vis its milieu.
According to this general genetic hypothesis, we suppose that the primitive
mode of existence of man in the world corresponds to a primitive union, prior to
any split, of subjectivity and objectivity. The first structuration, corresponding to
the appearance of a figure and a ground in this mode of existence, is the one that
gives rise to the magical universe. The magical universe is structured according to
the most primitive and meaningful of organizations: that of the reticulation of the
world into privileged places and privileged moments. A privileged place, a place
that has a power, is one that drains from within itself all the force and efficacy of
the domain it delimits; it summarizes and contains the force of a compact mass
of reality; it summarizes and governs it, as a highland governs and dominates a
lowland; the elevated peak is the lord of the mountain,1 just as the most impen­
etrable part of the woods is where all its reality resides. The magical world is thus
made of a network of places and of things that have a power and that are bound to
other things and other places that also have a power. This path, this enclosure, this
tsjisvoç [temenos] contains all the force o f the land, the key-point of the reality and
the spontaneity of things, as well as their availability.
In such a network o f key-points, of high-places, there is a primitive lack of
distinction between human reality and the reality of the objective world. These
key-points are real and objective, but they are that by which the human being is
immediately bound to the world, both in order to be influenced by it and in order
to act upon it; they are points of contact and of mutual, mixed reality, places of
exchange and of communication because they are formed from a knot between the
two realities.

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

179

And magical thought comes first, since it corresponds to the simplest and most
concrete, the most vast and flexible structuration: that o f reticulation. Within the
totality constituted by man and the world a network o f privileged points actualiz­
ing the insertion of human effort appears as an initial structure, and through which
the exchanges between man and the world take place. Each singular point concen­
trates within itself the capacity to command a part of the world that it specifically
represents and whose reality it translates, in communication with man. One could
call these singular points the key-points commanding over the man-world rela­
tion, in a reversible way, for the world influences man just as man influences the
world. Such are the peaks of the mountains or certain, naturally magical, mountain
passes, because they govern a land. The heart of the forest, the center o f a plain are
not only metaphorically or geometrically designated realities: they are realities that
concentrate the natural powers as they focalize human effort: they are the figurai
structures in relation to the mass that supports them and constitutes their ground.
When seeking to identify the remnants o f magical thought in the context of
the current conditions of life, we usually look at superstition as an example of the
schemas of magical thought. Superstitions are, in fact, merely a degraded vestige of
magical thought, and can only mislead the search for its true essence. One ought,
on the contrary, to refer to high, noble, and sacred forms of thought, requiring a
fully enlightened effort in order to understand the sense of magical thought. Such
is, for example, the affective, representative and voluntary foundation that supports
an ascent or an exploration. The desire for conquest and a sense of competition are
perhaps a part of the motivation that enables one to go from common existence to
these exceptional acts; but what is mostly at stake, when one invokes the desire for
conquest, is to legitimize an individual act for a community. In fact, the thought at
work in the individual or the small group of those who realize an exceptional act is
much more primitive and far richer.
The ascent, the exploration, and more generally any pioneering gesture, consists
in connecting with the key-points that nature presents. To climb a slope in order
to go toward the summit, is to make ones way toward the privileged place that
commands the entire mountain chain, not in order to dominate or possess it, but
in order to exchange a relationship of friendship with it. Man and nature are not
strictly speaking enemies before this connection at this key-point, but are simply
strangers to each other. For as long as it hasn’t been climbed, the summit is merely a
summit, a place that is higher than the others. The ascent gives it the character of a
place that is richer and fuller, and not abstract, a place through which this exchange
between the world and man comes to pass. The summit is the place from which the

180

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

entire mountain chain is seen in an absolute manner, whereas all the sights from all
the other places are relative and incomplete, arousing the desire for the view from
the summit. An expedition or a navigation allowing one to reach a continent by a
definite route do not conquer anything; and yet they are valid according to magical
thought, because they allow one to make contact with this continent in a privi­
leged place that is a key-point. The magical universe is made of a network of access
points to each domain o f reality: thresholds, summits, limits, and crossing points,
attached to one another through their singularity and their exceptional character.
This network of limits is not only spatial, but also temporal; there are remarkable
dates, privileged moments to begin this or that action. Moreover, the very notion
of a beginning is magical, even if all particular value is denied to the date of the
beginning; the beginning o f an action that is meant to last, the first act in a long
series of actions, would not in themselves have any majesty or any particular power
of direction, if they weren’t considered as governing the duration of the action as
well as the rest of the successful or unsuccessful efforts; dates are privileged points
in time allowing an exchange between human intention and the spontaneous
unfolding of events. Man’s insertion into natural coming-into-being is carried out
by way of these temporal structures, just as the influence of natural time is exerted
on every human life as it becomes a destined end.
In current civilized life, vast institutions are concerned with magical life, but
they are hidden by way of utilitarian concepts that justify them indirectly; in par­
ticular official holidays, celebrations, and vacations which compensate, with their
magical charge, for the loss of magical power that civilized urban life imposes on
us. Thus, holiday trips or vacations, which are considered ways for procuring rest
and distraction, are in fact a search for old or new key-points; these points can be
the big city for the country-dweller, or the countryside for the urbanite, but it is
more generally not just any point of the city or countryside; it is the shore or the
high mountain, or else the border one crosses in order to arrive into a foreign land.
The dates of public holidays are relative to privileged moments in time; sometimes,
there can be an encounter between the singular moments and the singular points.
Everyday time and space, in turn, serve as the ground to these figures; disso­
ciated from the ground, the figures would lose their signification; holidays and
celebrations are not simply a time of rest with respect to current life, through a
halting of current life, but rather a search for the privileged places and dates in
relation to the continuous ground.
The figurai structure, in primitive magical thought, is inherent to the world, it is
not detached from it; it is the reticulation of the universe into privileged key-points

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

181

through which the exchanges between the living thing and its milieu come to
pass. Now, it is precisely this reticular structure that is phase-shifted when one
passes from the original magical unity to technics or religion: figure and ground
separate by detaching themselves from the universe to which they adhered; the
key-points objectivize themselves and only retain their functional characteristics of
mediation, they become instrumental, mobile, capable of efficacy in any place and
in any moment whatsoever: as a figure, the key-points, detached from the ground
whose key they were, become technical objects, transportable and abstracted from
the milieu. At the same time, the key-points lose their mutual reticulation and
their power of influence from a distance on the reality that surrounded them; as
technical objects they have action only through contact, point by point, instant by
instant. This rupture of the network o f key-points frees the characteristics o f ground
which, in their turn, detach themselves from their own narrowly qualitative and
concrete ground in order to hover over the whole universe, the entirety o f space
and throughout all of duration, in the form o f detached powers and forces, above
the world. While the key-points objectivize themselves in the form o f concretized
tools and instruments, the ground powers subjectivize themselves by personifying
themselves in the form of the divine and the sacred (God, heroes, priests).
The primitive reticulation of the magical world is thus the source o f opposing
objectivation and subjectivation; at the moment of rupture o f the initial struc­
turation, the fact that the figure detaches itself from the ground is translated by
another detachment: figure and ground detach themselves from their concrete
adherence to the universe and follow opposite paths; the figure fragments itself,
while the qualities and forces of the ground universalize themselves: this parcel­
ing out and this universalization are, for the figure, ways of becoming an abstract
figure, and for the ground, a unique abstract ground. This phase shift of mediation
into figurai characteristics and characteristics of ground translates the appearance
of a distance between man and the world; the mediation itself, rather than being a
simple structuration of the universe, takes on a certain density; it objectivizes itself
in technics and subjectivizes itself in religion, leading to the appearance of the
first object in the technical object and of the first subject in divinity, when there
was hitherto only a unity of the living and its milieu: objectivity and subjectivity
appear between the living and its milieu, between man and the world, at a moment
when the world does not yet have a complete status of object nor man a complete
status of subject. One can furthermore note that objectivity is never completely
coextensive with the world, any more than subjectivity is completely coextensive
with man; it is only when the world is viewed from a technicist perspective and

182

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

man from a religious perspective that it appears that one can be said to be entirely
object, and the second entirely subject. Pure objectivity and pure subjectivity are
modes of mediation between man and the world, in their initial form.
Technics and religion are the organization of two symmetrical and opposed
mediations; but they form a couple, because they are each only a phase of the
primitive mediation. In this sense, they possess no definitive autonomy. What is
more, even taken in the system they form, they cannot be considered as enclosing
all of the real, since they are between man and the world, but do not contain all of
the reality of man and world, and cannot apply to it in a complete way. Directed
by the gap that exists between these two opposite aspects of mediation, science and
ethics deepen the relation between man and the world. With respect to science
and ethics, the two primitive mediations play a normative role: science and ethics
are born in the space defined by the gap between technics and religion, following
a median direction; the direction exercised by the precedence of technics and of
religion before science and ethics is o f the same order as that exerted by the lines
limiting an angle on the bisector of that angle: the sides of the angle can be indi­
cated by short segments, while the bisector can be indefinitely extended; in the
same way, on the basis of the gap between very primitive technics and religion, a
very elaborate science and ethics can progressively be constructed, that is guided
rather than limited by the basic conditions of technics and religion.
The origin of the split that has given rise to technical thought and religious
thought can be attributed to a truly functional primitive structure of reticulation.
This split has separated figure and ground, the figure giving the content of tech­
nics, and the ground that of religion. While, in the magical reticulation of the
world, figure and ground are reciprocal realities, technics and religion appear when
figure and ground detach themselves from one another, thereby becoming mobile,
fragmentable, displaceable and directly manipulate because they are not bound
to the world. Technical thought retains only the schematism of structures, of that
which makes up the efficacy of action on the singular points; these singular points,
detached from the world whose figure they were, also detached from one another,
losing their immobilizing reticular concatenation, become capable of being frag­
mented and available, as well as reproducible and constructible. The elevated place
becomes an observation post, a watchtower built on the plain, or a tower placed at
the entrance of a gorge. Often, a nascent technics need go no further than modi­
fying a privileged place, as when constructing a tower on the summit of a hill, or
by placing a lighthouse on a promontory, at the most visible point. But technics
can also completely create the functionality of privileged points. It merely retains

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

183

the figurai power of the natural realities, not the placement and natural localiza­
tion on a ground that is determined and given prior to any human intervention.
Fragmenting the schematisms more and more, it turns the thing into a tool or an
instrument, in other words a detached fragment of the world, capable of operating
efficiently and in any place and under any conditions, point by point, according
to the intention directing it and the moment man wants it. The availability of the
technical thing consists in being liberated from the enslavement to the ground
of the world. Technics is analytical, operating progressively and through contact,
setting aside the liaison through influence. In magic, the singular place enables
action on a domain in its entirety, just as it suffices to speak to the king in order
to win over an entire people. On the contrary, in technics the whole o f reality
must be traversed, touched, and treated by the technical object, detached from
the world and applicable to any point and at any moment. The technical object
distinguishes itself from the natural being in the sense that it is not part of the
world. It intervenes as mediator between man and the world; it is, in this respect,
the first detached object, since the world is a unity, a milieu rather than an ensem­
ble of objects; there are in fact three types o f reality: the world, the subject, and
the object, which is intermediary between the world and the subject, whose initial
form is that of the technical object.2

III.

- The divergence o f technical thought a n d o f religious thought

Technical thought — resulting from the rupture in the primitive structure of the
magical world's reticulation, and retaining the figurai elements that can be depos­
ited in objects, tools, or instruments — gains an availability from this detachment
that enables it to apply itself to every element of the world. However, this rupture
also produces a deficit: the technical tool or instrument has only retained figurai
characteristics detached from the ground to which they were once directly attached
since they arose out of an initial structuration that provoked the emergence of
figure and ground within a reality that had been one and continuous. In the mag­
ical universe, the figure was the figure of a ground and the ground, ground of a
figure; the real, the unity of the real, was at once figure and ground; the question
of a possible lack of the figures efficacy on the ground or of the ground’s influ­
ence on the figure could not arise, since ground and figure merely constituted a
2. Variation in the proofs: there are in fact three types o f reality: the world, man, and the object, intermediary between
the world and man, whose first form is the technical object.” — Ed.

184

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

single unity of being. Conversely, in technics, after the rupture, what the technical
object retained and maintained of figurai characteristics will henceforth encoun­
ter any ground whatsoever, an anonymous, foreign ground. The technical object
has become a bearer of form, a remnant of figurai characteristics, and it seeks to
apply this form to a ground that is now detached from the figure, having lost its
intimate relation of belonging, and capable of being informed by whichever form
it encounters, but in a violent, more or less imperfect manner; figure and ground
have become foreign and abstract in relation to each other.
The hylomorphic schema doesn’t describe only the genesis of living beings; per­
haps it doesn’t even essentially describe it. Perhaps it does not even come from
the reflected and conceptualized experience of technics: before the knowledge of
the living being and before the reflection on technics, there is this implicit ade­
quation of figure and ground, ruptured by technics; if the hylomorphic schema
appears to emerge from technical experience, it is as a norm or as an ideal rather
than as an experience o f the real; technical experience, putting into play vestiges
of figurai elements and vestiges of the ground characteristics gives new life to the
primary intuition of a mutual belonging o f matter and form, of a coupling pre­
ceding all splitting. In this sense, the hylomorphic schema is true, not because of
the logical use that has been made of it in ancient philosophy, but as an intuition
of a structure of the universe for man prior to the birth of technics. This relation
cannot be hierarchized, there cannot be more and more abstract successive stages
of matter and form, since the real model of the relation of matter and form is the
first structuration of the universe into ground and figure; indeed, this structuration
can only be true if it is not abstract, if it is on a single level; the ground is really
ground and the figure is really figure, it cannot become ground for a higher figure.
The manner in which Aristotle describes the relations between form and matter,
in particular the supposition that matter aspires to form (“matter aspires toward
form as the female to the male”), is already far from primitive magical thought, for
this aspiration can exist only if there is a prior detachment; but here, there is just
one being, which is both matter and form. Furthermore, perhaps it should not be
said that the individual being alone has form and matter; since the appearance o f a
figure-ground structure is prior to any segregation of units; the mutual relation of
correspondence of such a key-point and of such a ground neither presupposes this
key-point to be isolated from the network of other key-points nor this ground to
be without continuity with the other grounds: a universe is what is structured in
this way, and not a set [ensemble] of individuals; after the rupture of the primitive
reticulation the first detached beings to appear are technical objects and religious

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

185

subjects, and they are charged either with figurai characteristics or with character­
istics of ground: hence they do not fully possess form and matter.
The dissociation of the primitive structuring of the magical universe entails a
series of consequences for technics and religion, and through them, conditions the
subsequent coming-into-being of science and ethics. Unity belongs to the magical
world. The phase shift opposing technics and religion irreducibly leaves the con­
tent of technics with a status lower than unity and that of religion with a status
higher than unity. This is where all the other consequences come from. In order
to fully understand the status of the technicity of objects, one must grasp this
coming-into-being that puts the primitive unity out of phase. Religion, retaining
its ground-characteristics (homogeneity, qualitative nature, lack of distinction of
elements within a system of mutual influences, long distance action through space
and time, engendering ubiquity and eternity), represents the putting into play of
these functions of totality. A particular being, a defined object of attention or effort,
is always considered, in religious thought, to be smaller than the real unity, inferior
to the totality and included in it, surpassed by the totality o f space and preceded
and followed by the immensity of time. The object, the being, the individual, sub­
ject or object, are always grasped as less than unity, dominated by a sensed totality
that infinitely surpasses them. The source of transcendence lies in the function of
totality that dominates the particular being; according to the religious view, this
particular being is understood with reference to a totality in which it participates,
on which it exists, but which it can never completely express. Religion universalizes
the function of a totality, which is dissociated and consequently freed of all figurai
attachment limiting it; the grounds related to the world in magical thought, and
consequently limited by the very structuration of the magical universe, become
in religious thought a limitless spatial as well as temporal background; they retain
their positive qualities of ground (the forces, the powers, the influences, the qual­
ity), but rid themselves of their limits and of their belonging which attached them
to the hic et nunc. They become absolute ground, a grounding totality [totalité de
fond\. The universe is promoted on the basis of these freed up and, to a certain
extent, abstract magical grounds.
After the disjunction of ground and figure, religious thought preserves the other
part of the magical world: the ground, with its qualities, tensions, and forces; but,
like the figurai and technical schemas, this ground itself also becomes something
detached from the world, abstracted from the primitive milieu. And in the same
way that figurai schemas of technics, once freed from their adherence to the world,
fix themselves onto the tool or instrument by objectivizing themselves, so too

186

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

the ground qualities, made available by the mobilization of figures through technicity, fix themselves onto subjects. The technical objectivation that leads to the
emergence o f the technical object, mediating between man and the world, has reli­
gious subjectivation as its counterpart. In the same way that technical mediation
establishes itself by means of a thing that becomes the technical object, religious
mediation appears by virtue of the fixing of the characteristics of ground onto real
or imaginary subjects, divinities or priests. Religious subjectivation normally leads
to mediation through o f the priest, while technical mediation leads to the medi­
ation through the technical object. Technicity retains the figurai characteristic of
the primitive complex of man and the world, while religiosity retains the character
of ground.
Technicity and religiosity are not degraded forms of magic, or relics of magic;
they come from the splitting in two of the primitive magical complex, the origi­
nal reticulation o f the human milieu, into figure and ground. It is through their
coupling, and not in and o f themselves, that technics and religion are the heirs of
magic. Religion is not more magical than technics; it is the subjective phase of the
result of a split, while technics is the objective phase of this same split. Technics and
religion are contemporaries of one another and, considered on their own, they are
impoverished with respect to the magic from which they come.
Religion thus has by nature the vocation to represent the demand for totality;
when it splits into a theoretical mode and into a practical mode, it becomes by way
of theology the demand for a systematic representation of the real, according to an
absolute unity; through morality, it becomes the demand, from the ethical point
of view, for absolute norms of action, justified in the name of totality, superior to
any hypothetical, i.e., particular imperative; to both science and ethics it brings a
principle of reference to totality, which is the aspiration to the unity of theoretical
knowledge and to the absolute character of the moral imperative. The religious
inspiration constitutes a permanent reminder of the relativity of a particular being
with respect to an unconditional totality, going beyond all objects and subjects of
knowledge and of action.
Conversely, technics receive content that is always below the status of unity,
because the schemas of efficacy and the structures that result from the fragmen­
tation of the primitive network of key-points cannot apply to the totality of
the world. Technical objects are multiple and fragmentary by nature; technical
thought, enclosed within this plurality, can progress, but only by multiplying tech­
nical objects, without being able to recapture the primitive unity. Even by infinitely
multiplying technical objects, it is impossible to recover an absolute adequation

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

187

with the world, because each of the objects attacks the world only in a single point
and at a single moment; it is localized, particularized; by adding technical objects
to one another, one can neither recreate a world, nor recover the contact with the
world in its unity, which was the goal of magical thought.
In its relation to a determined object or to a determined task, technical thought
is always at a level inferior to that of unity: it can present several objects, several
means, and choose the best; but it nevertheless always remains inadequate to the
whole of the unity of the object or of the task; each schema, each technical object,
each technical operation is dominated and guided by the whole from which it
derives its means and its orientation, and which provides it with a never attained
principle of unity that it translates by combining and multiplying its schemas.
The vocation of technical thought is by nature representing the point of view of
the element; it adheres to the elementary function. Technicity, by introducing itself
into a domain, fragments it and leads to the appearance o f a chain of successive and
elementary mediations, governed by the unity of the domain and subordinated
to it. Technical thought conceives of an overall functioning [fonctionnement d ’e n­
semble] as a series of elementary processes, acting point by point and step by step;
it localizes and multiplies the mediation schemas, always remaining below unity.
The element, in technical thought, is more stable, better known, and in a certain
way more perfect than the ensemble; it is really an object, whereas the ensemble
always remains to a certain extent inherent in the world. Religious thought finds
the opposite balance: for religious thought, totality is that which is more stable,
stronger, and more valid than the element.
Technics bring, as much in the theoretical domain as in the ethical domain,
a concern for the element. In the sciences, the contribution of technics has con­
sisted in allowing a representation of phenomena taken one by one according to
a decomposition into simple, elementary processes comparable to the operations
of technical objects; such is the role of the mechanistic hypothesis that enables
Descartes to represent the rainbow as the overall result of the point by point trajec­
tory of each luminous corpuscle in each droplet of water in a cloud; it is according
to the same method that Descartes explains the functioning of the heart, decom­
posing a complete cycle into simple successive operations, and showing that the
functioning of the whole is the result of the play of elements necessitated by their
particular disposition (for example that of each valve). Descartes doesn’t ask him­
self why the heart is made in this way, with valves and cavities, but how it functions
given that this is how it is made. The application of schemas drawn from technics
does not account for the existence o f the totality, taken in its unity, but only for the

188

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

point by point and instant by instant functioning of this totality.
In the ethical domain, technical thought not only introduces means of action,
which are fragmentary and tied to the capacities of each object becoming a utensil,
but also a certain duplication of the action by technicity; a definite human action,
considered in its result, could have been accomplished by a determinate technical
functioning going through different stages; elements and moments of action have
their technical analog; an effort of attention, of memory, could have been replaced
by a technical operation; technicity provides a partial equivalence of the results of
an action; it accentuates the awareness of the action by the being who accomplishes
it in the form of results; it mediates and objectivizes the results of the action by
comparison with those o f the technical operation, performing a decomposition
of the action into partial results, into elementary accomplishments. In the same
way that in the sciences, technicity introduces the search for a how through the
decomposition o f an overall phenomenon {phénomène d ’ensemble] into elementary
operations, so too in ethics, technicity introduces the search for a decomposition
of a global action into elements of action; the total action being envisaged as that
which leads to a result, the decomposition of the action called for by technics con­
siders the elements of an action as movements obtaining partial results. Technicity
presupposes that an action is limited to its results; it is not concerned with the
subject of the action taken in its real totality, nor even with an action in its totality,
insofar as the totality o f the action is founded on the unity of the subject. The con­
cern with the result in ethics is the analog of the search for a how in the sciences;
result and process remain below the unity of action or of the whole [ensemble] of
the real.
The postulation of an absolute and unconditional justification that religion
directs at ethics translates into the search for intention, as opposed to the search for
the result that is inspired by technics. In the sciences, religious thought introduces
a quest for absolute theoretical unity, rendering necessary a search for the sense of
the coming-into-being and of the existence of given phenomena (hence answering
a why?), while technical thought brings with it an examination of the how? of each
of the phenomena.
In possessing a content that is at a lower level than unity, technical thought is
the paradigm of all inductive thinking, whether in the theoretical order, or in the
practical order. It contains this inductive process within itself, prior to any separa­
tion into a theoretical mode and a practical mode. Induction, in fact, is not only
a logical process, in the strict sense of the term; one can consider as inductive any
approach whose content has a lower status than that of unity, and which strives

THE GENESIS OF TECHNICITY

189

to attain unity, or which at least tends toward unity on the basis of a plurality of
elements where each is lower than unity. What induction grasps, what it starts
from, is an element that is not in itself sufficient and complete, that does not
constitute a unity; it thus goes beyond each particular element, combining it with
other elements that are themselves particular in order to attempt to find an analog
of unity: within induction there is a search for the ground of reality on the basis of
figurai elements that are fragments; to want to find the law beneath phenomena, as
with the induction of Bacon or J. S. Mill, or to seek only to find what is common
to all individuals of a same kind, as with Aristotle’s induction, is to postulate that
beyond the plurality of phenomena and individuals, a stable and common ground
of reality exists, which is the unity of the real.
It is no different for any ethics that would come directly from technics; to want
to compose the whole of the duration of life from a series of instants, extracting
from each situation what is pleasant in it and to want to construct the happiness
of life from the accumulation of these pleasant elements, as is done in ancient
Eudemonism or in Utilitarianism, is to proceed in an inductive manner, by trying
to replace the unity of life’s duration and the unity of human aspiration with a
plurality of instants and with the homogeneity of all successive desires. The elab­
oration to which Epicureanism submits desires has as its sole aim to achieve the
incorporation into the continuity of existence by proceeding in a cumulative
manner: for this purpose, each of the desires must be dominated by the subject,
enveloped in it, smaller than unity, so as to be able to be treated and manipulated
as a true element. This is why the passions are eliminated, since they cannot be
treated as elements; they are larger than the unity of the subject; they dominate
it, come from further afield than it does and tend to advance further than it does,
obliging it to go beyond its limits. Lucretius tries to destroy the passions from
within, by showing that they are based on errors; he does not, in fact, take into
account the element of tendency in passion, in other words, this force that inserts
itself into the subject, but that is vaster than it, and in relation to which it appears
as a very limited being; tendency cannot be considered as being contained in the
subject understood as unity. Wisdom, having reduced the forces at the origin of
action to a lower status than that of the unity of the moral subject, can organize
them as elements and reconstruct a moral subject within the natural subject; this
moral subject, however, never completely reaches the level of unity; between the
reconstructed moral subject and the natural subject, there remains a void that is
impossible to fill; the inductive approach remains within plurality; it constructs
a bundle of elements, but this bundle cannot be equivalent to a real unity. Every

190

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

ethical technique leaves the moral subject dissatisfied, because they do not grasp
its unity; the subject cannot content itself with a life that would be a sequence of
happy instances, even an interrupted one; a life that is perfectly successful, element
by element, is not yet a moral life; it lacks unity, which is what makes it the life of
a subject.
But religious thought, inversely, which is the foundation of obligation, creates
a search in ethical thinking for an unconditional justification that makes each act
and every subject appear as inferior to real unity; related back to a totality that
dilates infinitely, the moral act and subject derive their meaning only from their
relation with this totality; the communication between the totality and the subject
is precarious, because at every instant the subject is brought back to the dimension
of its own unity, which is not that of the totality; the ethical subject is de-centred
by the religious requirement.

I. - Technical thought an d aesthetic thought

According to a genetic hypothesis such as this one, it would be best not to con­
sider the different modes of thought as parallel to one another; thus, one cannot
compare religious thought and magical thought because they are not on the same
level; but on the contrary it is possible to compare technical thought and religious
thought, because they are contemporary to each other; in order to compare them,
it is not enough to determine their particular characteristics, as if they were the
species of a genus; one must return to the genetic realization of their formation,
for they exist as a couple, resulting from the split in primitive complete thought,
which was magical thought. As for aesthetic thought, it is never characteristic of
a limited field or of a determinate species, but only of a tendency; it is that which
maintains the function of totality. In this sense, it can be compared to magical
thought, provided however that one specifies that it does not contain, as magical
thought does, the possibility of splitting into technics and religion; indeed, far
from going in the direction of a split, aesthetic thought is what maintains the
implicit memory of unity; from one of the phases of splitting, it calls upon the
other complementary phase; it seeks totality in thought and aims at recomposing
a unity through an analogical relation where the appearance of phases could create
the mutual isolation of thought in relation to itself.

192

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Such a way of approaching aesthetic effort would undoubtedly be untenable if
one thus wanted to characterize works of art such as they exist in their institutional
state in a given civilization, and even more so, if one wanted to define the essence
of aestheticism. But, in order for works of art to be possible, they must be made
possible by a fundamental tendency in the human being, and by the ability to
experience the aesthetic impression in certain real and vital circumstances. The
artwork that is part of a civilization uses aesthetic feeling and satisfies, sometimes
artificially and in an illusory manner, mans tendency to seek a complement with
respect to a totality, when he exerts a certain type of thought. It would be insuf­
ficient to say that the work of art manifests the nostalgia for magical thought;
the work of art, in fact, grants us the equivalent of magical thought, since it
recovers — on the basis o f a given situation, and according to an analogical struc­
tural and qualitative relation — a universalizing continuity with respect to other
situations and to other possible realities. The work of art re-establishes a reticular
universe at least for perception. But the work of art doesn’t really reconstruct the
primitive magical universe: this aesthetic universe is partial, integrated, and con­
tained in the real and actual universe that has emerged from the split. In fact, the
work of art above all sustains and preserves the ability to experience aesthetic feel­
ing, just as language sustains the ability to think, without nevertheless itself being
identical to thought.
Aesthetic feeling is not relative to an artificial work; it signals, in the exercise
of a mode of thinking that is subsequent to the split, a perfection of completion
that makes the ensemble of acts of thought capable of surpassing the limits of its
domain so as to evoke the completion of thought in other domains: a technical
work perfect enough to be equivalent to a religious act, a religious work perfect
enough to have the organizational and operational force of a technical activity give
off a feeling of perfection. Imperfect thought stays within its domain; the perfec­
tion of thought allows the pexâpaoiç eiç âX ko [metäbasis eis alio] that gives the
fulfillment of a particular act a universal significance through which an equivalent
of the magical totality, which had been abandoned at the origin, is recovered at
the end of human effort; and the world itself must be present and authorize this
achievement after a long detour. The artistic impression implies the feeling of the
complete perfection of an act, a perfection that objectively gives it a radiance and
an authority through which it becomes a remarkable point of lived reality, a knot
of experienced reality. This act becomes an outstanding point of the network of
human life integrated within the world; from this outstanding point a higher kin­
ship with others is created, reconstituting an analog of the magical network of the
universe.

The aesthetic character of an act or a thing is its function o f totality, its exis­
tence, both objective and subjective, as an outstanding point. Any act, any thing,
any moment has in itself the ability to become an outstanding point of a new
reticulation of the universe. Every culture selects the acts and situations that are
apt to become outstanding points; but culture is not what creates the aptitude of
a situation to become an outstanding point; it only forms a barrage against certain
types of situations, leaving narrow straights for aesthetic expression with respect to
the spontaneity of the aesthetic impression; culture intervenes as limit rather than
as creator.
The destiny of aesthetic thought, or more precisely of the aesthetic inspiration
of all thought tending toward its own completion, is to reconstitute, within each
mode of thinking, a reticulation that coincides with the reticulation o f other modes
of thinking: the aesthetic tendency is the ecumenism of thought. In this sense,
beyond even the maturity of each of the genera o f thought, there occurs a final
reticulation that once again brings the separate types of thought which emerged
from the shattering of primitive magic closer together. The first stage of each type
of thought’s development is isolation, non-adherence to the world, abstraction.
Then, through its very development, each type of thought, which initially rejected
what is not itself and behaved as a species, after having affirmed itself according to
the unconditional monism of principles, pluralizes itself and widens according to
a principle of plurality; one could say that each thought tends to become reticular
and once more to adhere to the world after having distanced itself from it. After
having mobilized and detached the schematic figures of the magical world from
the world, technics return to the world to ally itself with it through the coinciding
cement and rock, of the cable and the valley, the pylon and the hill; a new reticu­
lation establishes itself, chosen by technics, privileging certain places of the world,
in a synergetic alliance of technical schemas and natural powers. This is where aes­
thetic feeling appears, in this agreement and this surpassing of technics once more
becoming concrete, integrated, and attached to the world through the most out­
standing key-points. The mediation between man and the world becomes itself a
world, the structure of the world. In the same manner, religious mediation accepts
concretizing itself, after a dogmatism that was detached from the concreteness of
the universe and having mobilized every dogma to conquer every representative
of humankind, in other words religious mediation accepts attaching itself to each
culture and to each human group according to relatively pluralistic modalities;
unity becomes the unity of a network rather than being a monist unity of a single
principle and a single faith. The maturity of technics and of religions tends toward

194

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

re-incorporation into the world, the geographical world for technics, the human
world for religions.
To this day, it does not appear possible for the two reticulations, that of tech­
nics within the geographical world and that of religions in the human world, to
analogically encounter each other in a real, symbolic relation. And yet only in
this way could the aesthetic impression state the rediscovery of the magical total­
ity, by indicating that the forces of thought have once again found one another.
Aesthetic feeling, common to both religious thought and technical thought, is the
only bridge that could allow for the linking of these two halves of thought that
result from the abandonment o f magical thought.
Philosophical thought, in order to know how to deal with the contribution of
technics and religion at the level of the distinction between the theoretical and
practical modalities, can thus ask itself how aesthetic activity deals with this con­
tribution at the level prior to the distinction of these modalities. What is broken in
the move from magic to technics and religion, is the first structure of the universe,
in other words the reticulation o f key-points, which is the direct mediation between
man and the world. And aesthetic activity preserves precisely this structure of retic­
ulation. It cannot really preserve it in the world, since it cannot substitute itself
for technics and religion, which would be to recreate magic. But it preserves it by
constructing a world in which it can continue to exist, and which is at once tech­
nical and religious; it is technical because it is constructed rather than natural, and
because it uses the power of applying technical objects to the natural world in order
to make the world of art; it is religious in the sense that this world incorporates the
forces, the qualities, the characteristics of ground that technics leave out; instead
of subjectivating them as religious thought does by universalizing them, instead
of objectivating them by enclosing them in the tool or instrument, as technical
thought does when it works on the basis of dissociated figurai structures, aesthetic
thought limits itself to concretizing the ground qualities via technical structures,
staying in the space between religious subjectivation and technical objectivation:
it thus makes the aesthetic reality, which is a new mediation between man and the
world, an intermediate world between man and the world.
Aesthetic reality in fact cannot be said to be either properly object or properly
subject; there is, of course, a relative objectivity to the elements of this reality; but
aesthetic reality is not detached from man and from the world like a technical
object; it is neither tool nor instrument; it can stay attached to the world, for
instance by being an intentional organization of a natural reality; it can also stay
attached to man, by becoming a modulation of the voice, a turn of phrase, a way

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT

195

of dressing; it does not have this necessarily detachable character of the instrument;
it can remain integrated, and normally it does stay integrated within human reality
or the world; a statue is not placed just anywhere, a tree is not planted just any­
where. There is a beauty of things and of beings, and a beauty in the ways of being,
and aesthetic activity starts by experiencing it and by organizing it, by respecting it
when it is naturally produced. Conversely, technical activity constructs separately,
detaching its objects, and applying them to the world in an abstract and violent
way; even when the aesthetic object is produced in a detached way, as a statue or a
lyre, this object remains a key-point of a part o f the world and o f human reality; the
statue thus placed before a temple is what makes sense for a defined social group,
and the mere fact that it is placed, in other words that it occupies a key-point that
it uses and reinforces but does not create, shows that it is not a detached object.
One can say that a lyre is an aesthetic object, insofar as it produces sounds, but
the sounds of the lyre are aesthetic objects only to the extent that they concretize
a certain mode of expression, of communication, that already exists in man; the
lyre can be carried like a tool but the sounds it produces and which constitute the
true aesthetic reality are integrated into human reality and the reality of the world;
the lyre can only be listened to in silence or with certain determinate sounds like
that of the wind or the sea, and not with the noise of the voice or the murmur of a
crowd; the sound of the lyre must integrate itself into the world, in the same way
the statue becomes integrated. Conversely, the technical object, insofar as it is a
tool, does not become integrated because it can act and function anywhere.
It is indeed this integration that defines the aesthetic object, and not imitation: a
piece of music that imitates noise cannot become integrated into the world, because
it replaces certain elements of the universe (for instance the noise of the sea) rather
than completing them. A statue, in a certain sense, imitates a man and replaces
him, but this is not why it is an aesthetic work; it is an aesthetic work because it
becomes integrated into the architecture of a town, marks the highest point of a
promontory, forms the endpoint of a wall, or sits atop a tower. Aesthetic percep­
tion senses a certain number of requirements: there are empty spaces that need
filling, rocks that need to bear a tower. There are a certain number of outstanding
places in the world, exceptional points that attract and stimulate aesthetic creation,
as there are a certain number of particular, radiant moments in a human life, that
distinguish themselves from others, that call for a work of art. The work, resulting
from this requirement of creation, from this sensitivity to places and moments of
exception, does not copy the world or man, but rather extends them and becomes
integrated with them. Even if it is detached, the aesthetic work does not arise from

196

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

a rupture in the universe or in the life time of man; it comes as a surplus of already
given reality, bringing it constructed structures, but constructed on foundations
that are a part of the real and which become integrated into the world. The aes­
thetic work thus makes the universe bud, extending it by establishing a network of
works, in other words by establishing radiating realities of exception, key-points of
a universe that is at once human and natural. More detached from the world and
from man than the magical universe s old network of key-points, the spatial and
temporal network o f artworks is a mediation between man and the world which
preserves the structure of the magical world.
It would, undoubtedly, be possible to affirm that there is a continuous transition
between the technical and the aesthetic object, since there are technical objects that
have an aesthetic value and that can be said to be beautiful: the aesthetic object
can then be conceived as not being integrated into a universe, and thus like the
technical object, can be considered as detached, since a technical object can be
considered as an aesthetic object.
In fact, technical objects are not inherently beautiful in themselves, unless one
is seeking a type of presentation that answers directly to aesthetic concerns; in this
case, there is a true distance between the technical object and the aesthetic object;
it is as if there were in fact two objects, the aesthetic object enveloping and masking
the technical object; this is the case for instance when one sees a water tower, built
near a feudal ruin, camouflaged by added crenels and painted the same color as
the old stone: the technical object is contained in this fake tower, with its concrete
tank, its pumps, its tubes: the hoax is silly, and seen as such from the very first
glance; the technical object retains its technicity beneath its aesthetic cover, hence
the conflict that arises which gives the impression of the grotesque. Every disguise
of a technical object generally produces the uncomfortable impression of a fake,
and appears like a materialized lie.
But in certain cases there is a beauty proper to technical objects. This beauty
appears when these objects become integrated within a world, whether it be geo­
graphical or human: aesthetic feeling is then relative to this integration; it is like
a gesture. The sails of a ship are not beautiful when they are at rest, but when the
wind billows and inclines the entire mast, carrying the ship on the sea; it is the sail
in the wind and on the sea that is beautiful, like the statue on the promontory. The
lighthouse by the reef dominating the sea is beautiful, because it is integrated as a
key-point of the geographical and human world. A line of pylons supporting the
cables that traverse a valley is beautiful, whereas the pylons, seen on the trucks that
bring them, or the cables, on the big rolls that serve to transport them, are neutral.

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT

A tractor, in a garage, is merely a technical object; however, when it is at work
plowing, leaning into the furrow while the soil is turned over, it can be perceived
as beautiful. Any technical object, mobile or fixed, can have its aesthetic epiphany,
insofar as it extends the world and becomes integrated into it. But it is not only
the technical object that is beautiful: it is the singular point of the world that the
technical object concretizes. It is not only the line of pylons that is beautiful, it is
the coupling of the lines, the rocks, and the valley, it is the tension and flexion of
the cables: herein resides a mute, silent and ever continued operation of technicity
applying itself to the world.
The technical object is not beautiful in every circumstance; it is beautiful when
it encounters a singular and remarkable place in the world; the high voltage line is
beautiful when it traverses a valley, the car when it turns, the train when it enters or
exits a tunnel. The technical object is beautiful when it has encountered a ground
that suits it, whose own figure it can be, in other words when it completes and
expresses the world. The technical object can even be beautiful with respect to an
object that is larger than itself serving as its ground, in some ways as its universe.
The radar antenna is beautiful when it is seen from the point o f view of a ship,
sitting atop the highest super-structure; placed on the ground, it is nothing more
than a rather crude cone, mounted on a pivot; it was beautiful as the structural
and functional completion of this whole [ensemble] that is the ship, but it is not
beautiful in itself and without reference to a universe.
This is why the discovery of the beauty of technical objects cannot be left to per­
ception alone: the function of the object needs to be understood and thought; in
other words, a technical education is needed if the beauty of technical objects is to
appear as an integration of technical schemas into a universe, within the key-points
of this universe. How, for instance, could the beauty of a radio relay placed on a
mountain, and oriented toward another mountain where another relay is placed,
appear to the one who only sees a tower of mediocre height, with a parabolic grid
in which a very small dipole is placed? All of these figurai structures need to be
understood as emitting and receiving the bundle of directed waves that propagates
from one tower to another, through the clouds and the fog; it is with respect to
this invisible, imperceptible, and real, actual transmission that the whole [ensemble]
formed by the mountains and the towers is beautiful, for the towers are placed at
the key-points of the two mountains in order to constitute the wireless cable; this
type of beauty is as abstract as that of a geometric construction, and the function of
the object needs to be understood in order for its structure, and the relation of this
structure with the world, to be correctly imagined, and aesthetically felt.

198

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

The technical object can be beautiful in a different way, through its integration
into the human world that it extends; thus a tool can be beautiful in action when it
properly adapts itself so well to a body that it somehow seems to be a natural exten­
sion of it and whose structural characteristics it appears to amplify; a dagger is only
beautiful in the hand that holds it; a tool, a machine or a technical ensemble, are
equally beautiful when they become integrated within the human world and cover
it over in expressing it; if the alignment of boards in a telephone center is beauti­
ful, then it is not beautiful in itself or in its relation with the geographical world,
since it can be anywhere; it is beautiful because these luminous flashes that trace
the multi-colored and moving constellations represent instant by instant the real
gestures of a multitude of humans, attached to one another through the crossing
of these circuits. The telephone call center is beautiful in action, because at every
instant it is the expression and realization o f an aspect of the life of a city and of a
region; a light is someone waiting, an intention, a desire, imminent news, a ringing
telephone that one won’t hear but that will resound far away in another house.
Here we witness the beauty found within the action; it is not simply instantaneous,
but is also made up of the rhythms of use in peak hours and evening hours. The
telephone call center is beautiful not because o f its characteristics as an object, but
because it is a key-point in collective and individual life. In the same vein, a traffic
light [.sémaphore] on a train platform is not beautiful in itself, but is beautiful by
way of its functioning as a traffic light, which is to say through its power to indi­
cate, to signify a stop or a track to be left free. In the same way again the Hertzian
modulation we receive, as a technical reality, from a different continent, barely
audible, made momentarily unintelligible underneath the static and distortions, is
technically beautiful, because it arrives charged with the overcoming of obstacles
and distance, bringing us the testimony of a faraway human presence, whose sole
epiphany it is. Hearing a nearby powerful transmitter is not technically beautiful,
because its value is not transformed by this power to reveal man, to manifest an
existence. And it is not only the overcoming of difficulty that makes the reception
of a signal emanating from a different continent beautiful; it is the power that this
signal has for making a human reality emerge for us, which it extends and manifests
in actual existence, by rendering it perceptible for us, when it would have otherwise
remained unknown despite being contemporary with ours. “White noise has as
much technical beauty as a meaningful signal, when it bears within itself witness
to a human being s intention to communicate; the reception of background noise
or of a simple continuous sinusoidal modulation can be technically beautiful when
it becomes integrated into a human world.

One can thus say that the aesthetic object is not strictly speaking an object, but
rather the extension of the natural or human world that remains integrated within
the reality that bears it; it is an outstanding point in a universe; this point is the
result of an elaboration and benefits from technicity; but it is not arbitrarily placed
in the world; it represents the world and focalizes its ground forces and quali­
ties, like a religious mediator; it keeps itself in an intermediary state between pure
objectivity and subjectivity. When the technical object is beautiful, it is because
it has been integrated into the natural or human world, just like aesthetic reality.
Aesthetic reality distinguishes itself from religious reality in that it can neither be
universalized nor subjectivized; the artist is not confused with the work, and, where
a certain idolatry arises, it is recognized as idolatry; it is the work of art’s technicity
that prevents aesthetic reality from being confused with the universal function
of totality; the work of art remains artificial and localized, produced at a certain
moment; it is not anterior and superior to the world and to man. The set [ensemble]
of all works of art perpetuates the magical universe and maintains its structure: it
marks the neutral point between technics and religion.
The aesthetic universe, however, is far from being a residue, a simple remnant of
a previous epoch; it represents the meaning o f coming-into-being diverging in the
passage from magic to technics and religion, but eventually having to re-converge
toward unity; the immanence of an aesthetic concern, within technics as within
religion, is the sign that technical thought, and indeed religious thought as well,
represent only a phase of complete thought. Technics and religion cannot com­
municate directly, but they can communicate through the mediation of aesthetic
activity; a technical object can be beautiful in the same way a religious gesture can
be beautiful, when they are integrated within the world at an outstanding place
and time. A norm of beauty exists within these two opposite modes of thinking,
a norm that makes them tend toward one another by applying them to the same
universe. Through the aesthetic work of art, the religious act is integrated, because
it is the religious act itself that becomes the work; a chant, a canticle, or a celebra­
tion are integrated to the hic et nunc. The religious gesture is beautiful when it acts
as an extension of the natural and the human world. A sacrament is thus a religious
gesture, and it is beautiful when it becomes integrated into the world, in a certain
place and a certain moment, because it is applied toward determinate people: the
qualities of ground once more encounter structures; it is through the beauty of the
celebration that religious thought rediscovers a network of moments and places
that have a religious value; religious gestures are beautiful when they belong to a
time and an era, not because of their external ornaments that have no connection

200

with the world; these ornaments that have no connection to a time or a place
isolate religious thought within the vain sterility of a ritual; they are of the order of
the grotesque, like the technical object concealed by an aesthetic mask. Religious
thought is beautiful when it integrates the function of totality into a spatio-tem­
poral network, when it intervenes with the forces and qualities of the ground of
the entire universe in a place and a moment. Furthermore, as in technical thought,
this aesthetically valid reintegration can only occur if it meets with the key-points
of the natural or human world. A temple, or a sanctuary, are not built by chance,
in an abstract way, without relation with the world; there are places of the natural
world that call for a sanctuary, just as there are moments in human life that call for
a sacramental celebration. In order for the aesthetic impression to arise in religious
thought, religion must be established in its own right, containing the forces and
qualities o f the universe s ground; but also the natural and the human world must
be waiting to extend and concretize themselves in religious places and moments
according to a norm that is, in a deep way, aesthetic.
Aesthetic reality is thus a surplus to given reality, but according to lines that
already exist in given reality; it is what reintroduces the figurai functions and the
functions o f ground into given reality which, in the moment of the magical uni­
verse’s dissociation, had become technics and religion. Without aesthetic activity,
there would only be a neutral zone between technics and religion without structure
and without qualities; by virtue of aesthetic activity, this neutral zone recovers a
density and signification, while staying central and balanced; via aesthetic works,
it recovers the reticular structure that stretched across the whole of the universe
before the dissociation of magical thought.
While technical thought is made up of schemas, of figurai elements without
ground reality, and religious thought is made up of ground qualities and forces
without figurai structures, aesthetic thought combines figurai structures and ground
qualities. Instead of representing elementary functions, like technical thought, or
the functions of totality, like religious thought, it holds elements and totality, as
well as figure and ground by way of analogical relation; the aesthetic reticulation of
the world is a network of analogies.
The aesthetic work is, in fact, linked not only to the world and to man, as a
unique intermediate reality; it is also linked to other works, without conflating
itself with them, without being in a material continuity with them, and keeping
its own identity; the aesthetic universe is characterized by the possibility of passage
from one work to another according to an essential analogical relation. Analogy
is the foundation for the possibility of going from one term to another without a

negation of the term by the succeeding one. It has been defined by Fr. de Solages3
as an identity of relations [rapports], in order to distinguish it from resemblance,
which in general would merely be a partial relation of identity. Complete analogy
is, in fact, more than an identity o f internal relations characterizing two realities; it
is this identity of figurai structures, but it is also an identity o f the grounds of these
two realities; on an even deeper level, it is even the identity of modes according
to which, within the two beings, there is exchange and communication between
the figurai structure and the ground of reality; it is the identity of the coupling of
figure and ground in two realities. Thus there is no true and complete analogy in
the domain of purely technical thought, nor in that of purely religious thought;
analogy applies to what one could call the fundamental operation o f existence
of beings, to that there is in them a coming-into-being that develops them by
making figure and ground emerge; aesthetics grasps the manner in which beings
appear and manifest themselves, i.e., by splitting into figure and ground; technical
thought grasps only the figurai structures of beings, which it identifies with its
schemas; religious thought grasps only the ground schemas of the reality of these
beings, according to which they are pure or impure, sacred or profane, saintly or
sullied. This is why religious thought creates homogeneous categories and classes,
like the pure and the impure, recognizing beings through inclusion within these
classes or through exclusion from these classes; technical thought deconstructs and
reconstructs the functioning of beings, elucidating their figurai structures; tech­
nical thought operates, religious thought judges, aesthetic thought operates and
judges at the same time, constructing structures and grasping the ground qualities
of reality, in a related and complementary way, in the unity of each being: it rec­
ognizes unity at the level of the definite being, of the object of knowledge and the
object of operation, rather than remaining, like technical thought, always below
the level of unity, or, like religious thought, always above this level.
It is due to the fact that it respects the unity of definite beings that aesthetic
thought has analogy as its fundamental structure; technical thought fragments
and pluralizes beings because it privileges figurai characteristics; religious thought
incorporates them into a totality in which they are qualitatively and dynamically
absorbed, thus becoming less than unity. In order to grasp beings at their level
of unity, and to grasp them as multiple without annihilating the unity o f each
through division or incorporation, each being must be operated and judged as a

complete universe without excluding other universes: the constitutive relation of
the beings coming-into-being, that which distinguishes and reunites figure and
ground, must be able to transpose itself from one unity of being4 to another unity
of being. Aesthetic thought grasps beings as individuated and the world as a net­
work of beings in a relation o f analogy.
Thus, aesthetic thought isn’t simply a remnant [souvenir] of magical thought; it
is what maintains the unity o f thought s coming-into-being as it splits into technics
and religions, because it is what continues to grasp a being in its unity, whereas
technical thought grasps the being below the level of its unity, and religious thought
above it.
The aesthetic work is not a complete and absolute work; it is that which instructs
as to how to move toward a complete work, which must be in the world and a part
of the world as if it really belonged to the world, and not simply as a statue in a
garden; while statues are beautiful in and of themselves, they do not make a house
or a garden beautiful, a house and a garden are beautiful in their own right. It is
by virtue of the garden that the statue can appear as beautiful, not the garden by
virtue o f the statue. It is with respect to the entire life of a man that an object can
be beautiful. Furthermore, it is never the object strictly speaking that is beautiful:
it is the encounter — which takes place about the object — between a real aspect
of the world and a human gesture. Hence, it is possible for there to be no aesthetic
object defined as aesthetic without nevertheless excluding the aesthetic feeling;
the aesthetic object is in fact a mixture: it calls upon a certain human gesture, and
furthermore contains an element o f reality that, in order to satisfy this gesture and
correspond to it, becomes the basis of this gesture, to which this gesture applies
itself and in which it accomplishes itself. An aesthetic object that would be nothing
more than objectively complementary relations would be nothing; lines would fail
to be harmonious if they were pure relations; the separate objectivity of number
and measure does not constitute beauty. A perfect circle is not beautiful insofar as
it is a circle. But a certain curve can be beautiful even if it might be very difficult
to find its mathematical formula. A line etching, representing a temple with very
precise proportions merely relays an impression of boredom and stiffness; but the
temple itself, worn by time and half crumbled, is more beautiful than the impecca­
ble model of its erudite restoration. For the aesthetic object is not strictly speaking
an object; it is also partially the depositary of a certain number of appeal aspects,5

which are subject reality, gesture, waiting for the objective reality in which this
gesture can exert and fulfill itself; the aesthetic object is both object and subject:
it awaits the subject in order to put it into motion and solicit in it perception on
the one hand and participation on the other. Participation consists of gestures, and
perception gives these gestures a basis in objective reality. In the perfect model with
its exact lines, indeed one finds all the objective elements represented [figurés], but
there is no longer this echoing or appealing that gives objects the power to give rise
to living gestures. Indeed, it is not the geometric proportions o f the temple that
give it this aspect of an appeal, but the fact that it exists in the world as a mass of
stones, of coolness, darkness, and stability, which inflect our powers o f effort or
desire, our fear or our élan in a primary and preperceptive way. The qualitative load
that is integrated in the world is what turns this block o f stones into a stimulant
[moteur] for our tendencies, rather than any geometric element that interests our
perception. What remains on the sheet of paper where the reconstruction is drawn,
is nothing more than geometric characters: they are cold and meaningless, because
the arousal of tendencies has not been provoked before they are perceived. The
work of art is aesthetic only to the extent that these geometric characteristics, these
limits, receive and fix the qualitative flow. It is hardly useful to speak o f magic to
define this qualitative existence: it is biological as well as magical, it concerns the
spontaneity of our tropisms, our primitive existence in the world before percep­
tion, as a being that does not yet grasp objects but directions, paths going upward
or downward, toward darkness and toward light. In this sense the aesthetic object
is ill-named, insofar as it evokes our tendencies; the object is an object only for
neologism, first introduced into English by J.E Brown as “invitational character” (Brown, “The Methods o f Kurt Lewin in
the Psychology o f Action and Affection,” in The Psychological Review 36:3 (May 1929); 200-221), soon thereafter took its
place in English and even eventually in German psychological vocabulary as “valence,” now defined by the Shorter O.E.D.
in psychology as “emotional force, significance, spec, the extent to which an individual is attracted or rejected by an object,
event, or person,” thanks to Donald Adams’s translation o f Lewin’s “The Conflict between Aristotelian and Galileian Modes
of Thought in Contemporary Psychology,” in the Journal o f General Psychology 5(1931); 141-177. According to Lewin, Auffordungscharakter determines the meaning of an object with respect to the “direction” o f the behavior o f the subject to which
it appeals in relation to the object. See Alfred J. Marrow, The Practical Theorist, The Life and Work o f Kurt Lewin (New York:
Basic Books, 1969), 55-63. Lewin’s impact on French psychology seems to have come through the original German article
as well as through Kurt Koffka’s citation, which Simondon cites in his study on psychology as his source for the term which
he translates as “caractère d ’appel," and which he interprets in the direction o f a sort of phenomenological realism: “Neither
need, nor experience are sufficient to explain appeal aspects: there exists a ‘silent’ (implicit) organization o f the object that
belongs to it just like its color or its shape, and which makes the appeal character inherent in it [...] In this way, Koffka
and Kurt Lewin abandon isomorphism: the system with a form is the whole [l ’ensemble] constituted by the subject and his
behavioral field, along with the entire network o f forces connecting the sub-ensembles o f the subject; there is no longer a
physical field having its form, followed by a physiological field with own its form, and then finally psychological field having
a third form, with these three independent forms being isomorphic among one another.” The forces at play in appeal aspects
cannot be identified with those o f classical mechanics,” which “can be reductively explained in abstract vectorial terms;
on the contrary, the tensions between Ego and objects have a nature and a specificity that are conserved in the effect; [...]
the type of tension appeals to a certain response: attack, flight, approach, help, contempt, compassion.” Simondon, Sur la
psychologie (1956-1967) (Paris: Presses universitaires de France, 2015), 105-107. [TN]

perception, when it is grasped as a localized hic et nunc. But it cannot be consid­
ered as an object in itself and prior to perception; aesthetic reality is pre-objective,
in the sense that one can say the world is above all an object; the aesthetic object
is an object at the end of a genesis that confers stability upon it and cuts it out;
before this genesis there is a reality that is not yet objective, even though it is not
subjective; it is a certain way o f being in the world for the living thing, comprising
the appeal, directions, tropisms in the strict sense of the word.
Real aesthetic feeling cannot be enslaved to an object; the construction of an
aesthetic object is nothing more than a necessarily vain effort to recover the magic
that has been forgotten; the true aesthetic function cannot be magical: it can only
functionally be a memory and a re-enacting of magic; it is a magic going backward,
a magic in reverse; whereas the initial magic is that through which the universe
reticulates into singular points and singular moments, art is that through which a
new reticulation emerges from out o f science, morals, mysticism, and ritual and as
a consequence o f this new reticulation, there is the emergence of a real universe, in
which the effort, which had been separated from itself, and which arose from the
internal disjunction that technics and religion underwent, comes to completion,
and as a consequence of these two expressions of magic, the initial effort of the
structuration of the universe. Art reconstitutes the universe, or rather reconstitutes
a universe, whereas magic starts from a universe in order to establish an already dif­
ferentiated structure that carves the universe into domains charged with sense and
power. Art aims at a universe on the basis of human effort and reconstitutes a unity.
Art is thus the counterpart of magic, but it cannot entirely be this counterpart until
after the two successive disjunctions.
There are two partial forms of art: sacred art and profane art; art can intervene as
a mediator between the mystical attitude and the ritual attitude; this art is like the
act of a priest, without being what constitutes a priest; it rediscovers something of
the mediator that has disappeared within the breaking apart that led to the appear­
ance of the mystical attitude and the ritualistic attitude in place of religion. Sacred
art is at once gesture and reality, object and subject, because it is at once the aes­
thetic attitude and the work; the work can exist only as something that is played;
it comes from inspiration. Art is made of artistic activity and of the objectivized,
actualized work; in this sense, there is mediation because there is celebration.
In the same way, profane art installs its object, namely the result of the artis­
tic work, between theoretical knowledge and moral exigency; the beautiful is an
intermediary between the true and the good, if one wishes to return to eclectic ter­
minology. Like the tool, the aesthetic object is an intermediary between objective

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT
AND OTHER SPECIES OF THOUGHT

205

structures and the subjective world; it is the mediator between knowledge and will.
The aesthetic object concentrates and expresses aspects of both knowledge and will.
Aesthetic expression and creation are at once knowledge and act. The aesthetic
act comes to fulfillment, like knowledge, within itself; but aesthetic knowledge is
mythical: it harbors a power of action; the aesthetic object is the result o f an oper­
ation that is an intermediary between knowledge and action.
The aesthetic object, however, couldn’t exist if aesthetic feeling didn’t exist; it is
merely what prepares, develops, and maintains natural aesthetic feeling, the sign of
the fulfillment of a true encounter between the diverse elements o f the world and
the diverse gestures o f the subject; every aesthetic object is either sacred or profane,
while aesthetic feeling is at once sacred and profane: it pre-supposes the mediation
of man at the same time as the mediation of the object; in aesthetic feeling, man
is the priest of destiny just as the object is the object of destiny; destiny coincides
with will.
This explains why there is in the work of art a stimulation of the tendencies and
a presence of the sensible qualities, which are the tendencies’ reference points. This
also explains the definite structuration that gives the work of art the characteristics
of the consistency of an object: the work of art calls upon both practical judgment
and theoretical judgment.
But the aesthetic judgment is not necessarily the one made in the presence of
a work of art; the work of art uses the prior natural existence of the spontaneous
aesthetic judgment; furthermore, when the work o f art presents a certain duration,
aesthetic judgment is not given from the start in a state of fulfillment; there is a
certain evolution of judgment that is initially more theoretical and ethical, and
which becomes more and more purely aesthetic as the completion of the work
approaches; ancient tragedy offers a case of this evolution of modality during the
course of the unfolding of the work: only the denouement corresponds to true
aesthetic judgment; the duration that precedes it contains practical and theoret­
ical judgments. Even in the aesthetic contemplation of a work that makes use of
space rather than time, like painting or sculpture, there is a certain distinction of
theoretical judgments and practical judgments, in a first moment of seeing, before
the fusion and pure discovery of aesthetic feeling; one could even say that the
work of art would always give off the experience of a certain disjunction between
theoretical judgment and practical judgment if there wasn’t the underlying solidity
of technical judgment to sustain it: the work of art is a thing that has been made.
Aesthetic judgment generally remains a mixture of technical judgment and pure
aesthetic judgment; of course there can be moments of pure aesthetic judgment

206

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

throughout the unfolding of the perception of work of art; but one would think
that aesthetic judgment would have the tendency to divide itself into theoretical
judgment and practical judgment if the underlying work of art wasn’t there to
sustain the unity o f apprehension, as a reality that has been made, and which
in this respect has a real original unity. It is because of this presence of technical
judgment in aesthetic apprehension that aesthetic judgment more easily appears in
art than in life; in life, aesthetic judgment is extremely rare because an encounter
is necessary that can only occur after a period of expectation and from an effort
that polarizes the world, and if chance makes the occasional determinations of the
world coincide with this universalized and concretized expectation; disappoint­
ment is infinitely more frequent than the aesthetic manifestation.
True aesthetic feeling, combining within itself the feelings of sacred art and of
profane art, not only calls upon the aesthetic object (as profane art) or the human
gesture of sacred art, but upon one and the other together: here man celebrates in
the midst o f a world of objects that have aesthetic value; the ancient tragic (aes­
thetic) is at once sacred and profane; it is what most closely approaches real life
[la vraie vie] insofar as it arouses the feeling o f the tragic, which is to say the feeling
that seizes upon something within the human as a mediator; man’s every gesture
has a certain sacred aesthetic value; it intervenes between the totality of life and the
world; it calls for participation. Destiny is this coincidence of the line of life and
o f the reality of the world via a network of gestures with exceptional value; every
mediating gesture is aesthetic, even and perhaps essentially outside the work of art.
The complete aesthetic gesture, at once sacred and profane, can hardly be found in
the work of art, which is generally either sacred or profane. The complete aesthetic
feeling is inseparable from the feeling of destiny; it does not take, from the sacred,
the limitation to a definite domain of the real; it does not take, from the profane,
the artificially objectivizing turn.
The sacred and the profane encounter each other in real life through the aes­
thetic impression; sacred art and profane art are only adjuvants of the complete and
real aesthetic feeling, this feeling is not born from the work of art, be it sacred or
profane, and it doesn’t even require that the work of art be present at the moment
in which the feeling manifests itself. The Romantics, who did not ask to be accom­
panied by the artificial work of art, found the true aesthetic feeling in life, without
recourse to the explicit artwork that is made to be a work of art. Romanticism,
however, is only one of the aspects of tragic thought, which attaches art to life, and,
for this reason, welds together the sacred and the profane. The mixture o f genres in
art is a direct consequence of Romanticism; but true Romantic aesthetic feeling is

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT
AND OTHER SPECIES OF THOUGHT

207

not in the artwork: it is in the attitudes of life. In classical art on the contrary, there
is no reunion of sacred art and profane art: the forms of art are thus separated from
one another, and true aesthetic feeling is in the work of art.
Established art [art in stitué can achieve a partial meeting among thoughts
that are closely related; but it cannot entirely ally religious thought with technical
thought; by producing works of art, established art is nothing but a movement
of a departure toward aesthetic existence, in which, for the subject, an encounter
can take place, as the sign of a real accomplishment; true aesthetic feeling is of
the domain of a reality experienced as reality; established art, artificial art is still
nothing more than a preparation and a language for discovering true aesthetic
feeling; true aesthetic feeling is as real and profound as magical thought; it comes
from the real encounter between different particular modalities, recomposing the
magical unity in itself, giving this unity back after a long disjunction. The aesthetic
modality is thus a reunion of all modalities after their differentiation and separate
development: through its power of unification, the aesthetic modality is what is
the most functionally approximate to primitive magical thought. But the aesthetic
impression can only be truly functionally equivalent to magic if it expresses a real
encounter between different modal orders of thought, and is not simply the result
of a factitious construction. The true sense and function of established art is to
maintain the demand for unity throughout the modal orders that are differentiated
in thought; if instituted art becomes aestheticism — in other words, if it gives and
replaces a real and ultimate satisfaction considered as vitally experienced — it then
becomes a filter that prevents true aesthetic feeling from appearing.
One can say that in this sense there is a continuous line going from magical
thought to aesthetic thought, since in each o f the modal orders o f thought there are
other underlying orders, which are the symbolic translation of the broken prim­
itive unity. Thus within technics there is also a presence of its opposite, namely
religious thought, which adds a certain sense of perfection to technics, namely
technical beauty; in religious thought there is a desire to extend its mediation into
the technical domain, and religious thought, while defending its norms against the
penetration of the norms of technical thought, still tends toward a certain technicity, toward a definite regularity, toward forms that aestheticize it just as technical
beauty aestheticizes technicity: within religious thought there is a religious beauty
that represents the search for a complementary force whose aim is to recover the
magical unity which has been broken, in the same way that there is within tech­
nical thought a search for a beauty through which the technical object becomes
prestigious; the priest tends to be an artist just as the technical object tends to be a

208

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

work of art: the two mediators aestheticize themselves in order to find an equilib­
rium that conforms to magical unity.
It must nevertheless be noted that, in the case of both religion and technicity, this premature aestheticizing tends toward a static satisfaction, toward a false
completion prior to a complete specification; true technicity and true religion
should not tend toward aestheticism, which maintains a rather facile magical unity
through compensation, and thereby preserves magic and religion at a rather poorly
developed level. The real development of thought requires the different attitudes of
thought to be capable of detaching from each other and to even become antagonis­
tic, for they cannot be simultaneously thought and developed by a single subject;
they require, in fact, that a subject realize them and assume them in a profound,
essential way, turning one of them into the principle o f the subjects existence and
life. In order for an attitude to develop, thought must even be exchanged between
several subjects and take on a temporal dimension, becoming a tradition and devel­
oping along a temporal line: hence the incorporation of a definite type into a social
group as the foundation of its existence, as justification of its existence, as myth.
The more social or collective a thought becomes, however, the more it serves the
individuals as a means o f participation within the group, the more this thought
also particularizes and weighs itself with historical elements and becomes stereo­
typed; a second function of aesthetic judgment thus becomes that of preparing
for the communication between social groups representing the specialization of
different types of thought. We have thus far presented the different modalities as if
the human subject was individual and not collective; in reality, insofar as the sub­
ject is a collective being, art plays a preparatory role in realizing a commonality of
the most diverse attitudes. There are technicians and priests, there are scholars and
men of action: the original magical load that allows these men to have something
in common and to find a way of exchanging their ideas resides in aesthetic inten­
tion. The category of the beautiful, in a specialized thought, is what announces
that the needs of complementary thoughts are immanently and implicitly fulfilled
by the very accomplishment of this specialized thought; the impression of beauty
can hardly arise at the beginning of an effort, but only at its end, because this
effort must first have followed its own direction, and it must furthermore arrive at
the accomplishment of something it neither hoped to accomplish nor had already
accomplished; beauty is gracious insofar as it is the accomplishment of what one
didn’t seek to accomplish, of that for which one didn’t directly make an effort,
and which was nevertheless obscurely felt as a complementary need, via a ten­
dency toward totality. The tendency toward totality is the principle of the aesthetic

209

search. But this same search begins a progressus a d indefinitum , because it is the will
to perfection in each subject matter, whereas perfection aims precisely at domains
other than that in which it wishes to realize itself; under these conditions, the aes­
thetic quest cannot find stable norms, since it is driven by negative characteristics,
which is to say by the feeling that a mode o f thought discounts other modes of
thought that are equally valid: the tendency of aesthetics is the endeavor to realize
an equivalence of all other domains within a single determinate domain; the more
particular and specialized a domain is, the more aesthetic requirements push for
the construction of a perfect work, this perfection being a will to overcome itself
in order to be equivalent to other domains and in order to realize them through an
overabundance of this local accomplishment: as if this local perfection, radiating
and overflowing superfluity, had the power to be what this domain is not.
Art is thus will to universality, will within a particular being to surpass its mode
and realize all the modes within its own through a surpassing of its limits: perfection
is not a fully realized normativity o f limitation, but the discovery of an excellence
so great, functioning within itself and reverberating within itself with such pleni­
tude that it attains all other modes and would be capable of rendering them by way
of an impoverishment. There is, in fact, an illusion in the aesthetic enterprise, since
it is perhaps impossible that a determinate mode of thought can be equivalent to
all the others by virtue of its perfection. Aesthetic intention, however, contains the
affirmation of the possibility o f this overcoming, of this equivalence or this mutual
convertibility of excellences. Art is a quest for a concrete excellence, engaged in
each mode and with its sights set on finding the other modes through the move­
ment of a mode within itself; this is how art is magical: it aims at finding modes
without going outside a mode, only by dilating it, reworking it, and perfecting
it. There is magic because there is a supposition of a reticular structure of the real
universe; each mode magically exceeds itself while staying objectively within itself.
This presupposes that the other modes are also subject to the same internal quest: it
is not the stability of a mode that communicates with the stability of another, but
excellence with excellence, aesthetic intention with aesthetic intention.
One could say, once again referring to the word transductivity, that art is what
establishes the transductivity of the different modes in relation to each other; art
is what remains non-modal in a mode, just as around an individual there remains
a pre-individual reality associated with it and enabling it to communicate in the
institution of the collective.

210

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Aesthetic intention is what, to this extent, establishes a horizontal relation
between different modes of thought. It is what allows the passing from one domain
to another without recourse to a common genus; aesthetic intention harbors the
transductive power that leads from one domain to another; it is the exigency of
an overflowing and o f the passage to the limit; it is the opposite of the sense of
propriety, o f the limit, o f the essence contained in a definition, of the correlation
between an extension and a comprehension.
Aesthetic intention in itself is already the exigency of totality, the quest for a
whole reality. Without aesthetic intention, there would be an indefinite quest for
the same realities within ever more narrow specializations; this is why aesthetic
intention appears like a perpetual deviation on the basis of the central directions
of a quest; in reality this deviation is a quest for the real continuity beneath the
arbitrary fragmentation of domains.
Aesthetic intention enables the establishment of a transductive continuity attach­
ing the modes to one another: one moves from the religious modes of thought to
the modes of technical thought (perhaps it is better to say: from post-religious to
post-technical thought), according to the following order: theological, mystical,
practical, and theoretical; but this transductive relation is closed in on itself, so
much so that it can only be grasped through spatial representation; one effectively
goes from the theoretical to the theological as one moves from the mystical to the
practical; there is a continuity between these two objective orders and between
these two subjective orders. There is also continuity from a subjective order to an
objective order within each of these two domains, the technical and the religious.
Aesthetic intention thus doesn’t create, or at least should not create a specialized
domain, which is that of art; but art, o f course, develops into a domain and has an
implicit internal finality: to preserve the transductive unity of a domain of reality
that tends to separate itself by way of specialization. Art is a deep reaction against
the loss of meaning and of the attachment to the whole [ensemble ] of being in its
destiny; it is not or must not be compensation, a reality occurring after the fact, but
on the contrary a primitive unity, a preface to a development according to unity;
art announces, prefigures, introduces, or completes, but it does not make real: it is
the deep and unitary inspiration that begins and consecrates.
One could even ask oneself whether art, to the extent that it observes, is not also
what somehow sums up [résume] and renders an ensemble of realities transposable
to another temporal unit, to another moment in history. Art, in the celebration
and final investiture that it brings about, transforms the fulfilled and localized real­
ity hic et nunc into a reality that will be able to traverse time and space: it renders

AND OTHER SPECIES OF THOUGHT

211

human fulfillment non-finite; it is commonly said that art eternalizes different
realities; art, in fact, does not eternalize but renders transductive, giving a localized
and fulfilled reality the power to pass to other places and other moments. It does
not make eternal, but grants the power of rebirth and the capacity to fulfill oneself;
it leaves the seeds of quiddity; it gives the particular being realized hic et nunc the
power to have been itself but also to be itself one more time and a multitude of
other times; art loosens the bonds of ecceity [eccéite']; it multiplies ecceity, giving
identity the power to repeat itself without ceasing to be identity.
Art transgresses ontological limits, liberating itself with respect to being and
non-being: a being can become and repeat itself without negating itself and with­
out refusing to have been, art is the power of iteration that doesn’t negate the reality
of each new beginning; in this way it is magical. Because o f it every reality, singular
in space and in time, is nevertheless a networked reality: this point is homologous
to an infinity of others that echo it and that are this point as well, however without
negating the ecceity [eccéite] of each node o f the network: here, in this reticular
structure of the real, resides what one can call aesthetic mystery.

II. - Technical thought, theoretical thought, p ractic al thought

The power of convergence of aesthetic activity fully exerts itself only at the level of
the relation between the primitive forms of technics and religions. But the power
of divergence contained within the autonomy of the development o f technics and
religions creates a new order of modes of thinking that arise out of the splitting
of both technics and of religions, which are no longer at the natural level of aes­
thetic thought. With respect to these modes, aesthetic thought appears primitive;
it cannot make them converge through its own exercise, and its activity serves
only as a paradigm to orient and support the effort of philosophical thinking. Like
aesthetic thought, philosophical thinking is situated at the neutral point between
opposite phases; but its level is not that of the primary opposition resulting from
the phase shift of magical unity; it is that of the secondary opposition between the
results of the splitting in two of both technical thought and religious thought. It is
necessary to study this secondary splitting, and particularly that of technical activ­
ity, in order to know how philosophical thinking can efficiently and fully play its
post-aesthetic role of convergence, by applying itself to the becoming of technicity.

212

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

The level o f the primary modalities o f thought (technical, religious, and aesthetic)
is characterized by the merely occasional use of communication and expression;
aesthetic thought is of course capable of being communicated, and, technics and
even religions can be learned, transmitted, and taught to a certain extent. However,
it is through direct experience — which requires the subject to be put into a sit­
uation — that these primitive forms of thought are transmitted; the objects they
create, their manifestations, can fall under the senses; but the schemas of thought,
the impressions and norms that constitute these thoughts themselves and nourish
them are not directly of the order o f expression; one can learn a poem, contemplate
a pictorial work, but this does not teach poetry or painting: what is essential in
thought is not transmitted by expression, because these different types of thought
are mediations between man and the world, and not encounters between subjects:
they do not presuppose a modification o f an intersubjective system.
The secondary modalities of thought, on the contrary, presuppose communica­
tion and expression, they imply the possibility o f a judgment, a node of expressive
communication, and they contain, in the strict sense, modalities and attitudes of
the subject as it finds itself before the content of its enunciation.
Now, technicity leads to certain types o f judgments, and in particular theoretical
judgment and practical judgment, or at least certain theoretical judgments and
certain practical judgments.
It must in fact be noted that technicity is not alone in generating modalities of
communicated thought by way o f over-saturation and splitting; religious thought
is also a basis for judgments.
The splitting of technical thought, like that of religious thought, arises from
an oversaturated state of this thinking; at the primitive level, technical thought
does not make judgments any more than religious thought does; judgments appear
when the modalities differentiate themselves, for the modalities are modalities of
thought, and in particular modalities of expression, before being modalities of
judgment; judgment is simply the nodal point of expressive communication; it is
as an instrument of communication that it has a modality, because the modality
is defined by the type of expression; the modality is the expressive intention that
envelops judgment, that precedes it and follows it. Modality is not contained in
judgment; it makes it appear; judgment concretizes the modality of expression, but
it does not exhaust it.
In technical activity, two opposing modalities emerge when an action fails,
which is to say, when it forms an oversaturated, incompatible system with the
world that it incorporates; if a single gesture always led to an identical result,

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT
AND OTHER SPECIES OF THOUGHT

213

if technical action were monovalent and without fissure, there wouldn’t be any
emergence of opposing modalities; technical thought would always be implicitly
grasped by the efficacy of the accomplished act, and it would be indistinguishable
from this act. But the failure of the technical gesture phase shifts the technical act
into two opposing realities: one figurai, made of schemas of action, habits, and
structured gestures learned by man as a means, and the other a ground reality,
the qualities, dimensions, and powers of the world to which the technical gesture
applies itself. This ground reality that undergirds the technical gesture is the dyna­
mism of things, that through which they are productive, and that which gives them
their fecundity, efficacy, and useable energy. Technics seeks the thing as power and
not as structure, it seeks matter as a reservoir of tendencies, qualities, and its own
particular virtues. It is nature as support and as auxiliary o f action, as an adjuvant
from which one expects efficacy, so that the gesture may prove effective. It is nature
as a reserve of potentials, the (puoiç \physis] that reveals its nature when it is lacking:
it is something other than the schematic gesture of man; the gesture of man must
be accomplished according to this productive nature in order to be technically effi­
cient. This potentiality o f nature, far richer than simple virtuality, is the foundation
of the modality of possibility. Logical possibility is only the weakened reflection of
the true virtuality of (pbcnç [physis], grasped and apprehended by way o f its distinc­
tion from the human gesture, when the technical intention fails.
Virtuality, in turn, is a theoretical and objective modality, because it corresponds
to that which is not within the power of man, and is nevertheless a power; it is pure
power, absolute power.
Together with virtuality, the failure of technical action leads to the discovery of
what subjectively corresponds to this virtuality, which is the possible as optative;
the ensemble of schemas is an incomplete reality; the schemas of action are the
beginnings of action, an incitement applied to the world so that an operation
is carried out [se réalisé\\ this action is wanted, posited as desirable and already
effectively desired insofar as man tends to carry it out; but it does not possess all
its autonomy within itself, since human wish only has the status of a kernel of
action, and must encounter the virtuality of the world for there to be fulfillment:
the practical optative corresponds to the theoretical virtual like a figurai reality
corresponds to a ground reality; the optative is the figure of the virtual. There is an
implicit coupling here, directly given in the technical unity, prior to all modality.
The emergence of these two modalities — one theoretical, the other practical —
expresses the break in a first unity that was comprised of both knowledge and of
action, concrete and complete technical thought.

214

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

But this is only one o f the sources of practical thought and theoretical thought;
the postulation of virtualities is not science, no more so than the possibility of
schemas is practical thought; physiology 6 is a first attempt at science, but it is not
science. It is essential to note that the notion of potential virtuality is always partic­
ular: it aims at a parceled elementary reality, taken piece by piece; it is not relative
to the whole of the world; potential is only potential within a certain domain of the
real and not within all o f the real in the stable system that it forms: this character
of virtuality, which often goes unnoticed, comes from technicity; technical action
is effectively efficient or inefficient according to local powers; it must encounter in
the hic et nunc a virtuality ready to actualize itself under the technical gesture; vir­
tuality becomes integrated, localized, and particular. It is the objectively possible,
just as the optative is the subjectively possible. It is thus natural that this modality
of virtuality is what governs the inductive approach, aiming at the discovery of a
truth through the accumulation o f terms experienced one after the other. Induction
is grounded, in its primitive forms, on virtuality and not on necessity; the truth
obtained through induction could have been other than what it is; it is the adjunc­
tion of all these terms of virtuality that tend toward the real; one by one, they are
virtual; but the system of all virtualities accumulated and linked to one another
tends toward an equivalent of a basic stability, that of a virtual that is always avail­
able and present everywhere, corresponding to the “laws of nature.” But before the
laws o f nature there are, to ground the primary inductive approach, the powers of
nature, the (pnoeiç [physeis], the capacities to produce effects. Inductive thought is
a thought that accumulates particular powers, rearranging them by similarities and
domains, classifying the real according to the natural powers that can be discov­
ered. In its first form, inductive thought prepares a general table of classification for
technical action, destined to avoid technical failure by defining all the powers that
the action can solicit, and by recognizing them deeply enough for it always to be
possible to reach them, below the diversity of sensorial impressions.
Inductive thought is thus not defined only by its content; it is the form of theo­
retical thought that arises from out of the fragmentation [l'éclatement] of technics;
it is, for method, the thought that goes from particular elements and experiences
to the whole of the collection and to a general affirmation, seizing the validity of
the general enunciation by way of the accumulation of the validity of particular
experiences. For content, inductive thought is that which retains the qualities and
the genetic powers of the world, such as the heavy and the light, the cold and the
damp, the rigid and the flexible, the putrescible and the non-putrescible. All these
6.

This word is taken in the sense we give it when we speak of the “Ionian physiologists.’

characteristics of things that the first inductive thought seeks are those that were
implicated in technical operations: this does not in the least mean that theoretical
inductive thought is a pragmatic thought, turned toward action and having as a
sole aim to enable technical action; it is precisely the inverse: inductive thought
comes from the failure of direct, parceled, localized technical action; this failure
provokes the disjunction of the figurai reality and the ground reality that was asso­
ciated with it; inductive thought organizes the ground realities. But, even if it is
not oriented toward action, inductive thought still bears the mark o f its technical
origin: in order for a ground reality, a (pi3aiç [physis] to be grasped, it must have
been associated with a definite technical operation: what induction retains, is what
could have been evoked by the optative o f action.
Through its failure, technical thought discovers that the world cannot be entirely
incorporated into technics; if the world was made only of figurai structures, a tri­
umphant technics would never encounter any obstacles; but, beyond the figurai
structures that are homogeneous with the human gesture, there is another type of
reality that negatively intervenes as. an unconditional limit of the human gesture s
efficacy. If water could rise to any height in the body o f a pump, then the technics
of the hydraulic engineer \fontainier ] would suffice: the higher the height to be
attained, the more perfect the construction of the body of the pump, the adjust­
ment of the tubes, and the valve lapping should be: without a change of fields or
the use of a new type of notions, there would only be proportionality between the
importance of the result to be attained and the technical effort of construction. But
when the water does not rise beyond a certain height in the suction pumps, then
technical notions become inadequate; it is no longer the perfection of the technical
object that is in question; the best hydraulic engineer cannot make the water rise
above 10.33 meters; the world does not supply the technical gesture with a docile
matter with no spontaneity; the world subjected to technical operation is not a
neutral ground: it has counter-structures, opposing the figurai technical schemas.
Nevertheless, these obstructive powers of the world intervene within the axiomatic
of each technics like an inexhaustible reserve of conditions that oversaturate this
axiomatic as technics improve: a bucket wheel or an Archimedes screw do not
encounter a counter-structure; but the elaborate art of the water works engineer
capable of constructing a suction pump encounters this obstructive power. In par­
ticular it is worth noting that the new condition coming from this obstructive
power is not homogeneous with the conditions of technical improvement: the
conditions of technical improvement tend toward saturation through the concretization of the object systematizing itself as it perfects itself; but it is in addition to

216

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

these conditions, and in a way that is not compatible with them, that the condition
imposed by nature intervenes.
It is in order to recover the broken compatibility that technical thought splits
into praxis and theory: theoretical thought which arises from technics is the
thought at the heart of which it is possible to think the totality of the conditions of
operation in a way that is once again homogeneous and coherent; through hydro­
statics the system o f conditions o f the rising of water within the body of the pump
can once again be homogeneous: since the rising of the water is explained by the
difference in pressures exerted at the base and at the summit of the column, there
is no longer a difference in kind between the previous technical conditions (leaking
in the body of the pump allowing a residual pressure to subsist at the top of the
water column, with a minimum pressure at the valve opening) and the previous
non-technical conditions (the height of the column of liquid, the atmospheric
pressure, and the liquids vapor pressure); all the conditions are combined together
in a homogeneous system o f thought, centered around the notion of pressure,
which is at once natural and technical; the technical failure leads thought to change
levels, to ground a new axiomatic which, in a homogeneous way and by making
them compatible, incorporates the figurai schemas of technical operation and the
representation of the limits imposed by nature upon the efficacy of these figurai
schemas in the technical gesture; it is the concept that is this new representation
establishing the notional compatibility. Science is conceptual not because it comes
from technics, but because it is a system o f compatibilities between the technical
gestures and the limits imposed by the world upon these gestures; if it came directly
from technics, then it would only consist of figurai schemas, and not of concepts.
The natural qualities, the (puaeiç [physeis], understood as the material for technical
gestures, constitute the most primitive type of concepts and mark the beginnings
of inductive scientific thought.
The other result of this disjunction is the emergence of a practical thought that is
not integrated within the real, but that is also made up of a collection of schemas,
that are separated from each other from the very beginning. These optatives, freed
from their application to the technical gesture, coordinate with each other like
the objective virtualities of the world, and form a practical whole according to a
process analogous to that of induction in theoretical knowledge. This is one of the
bases of practical morals, with values such as those of efficacy of effort, of non-ab­
surdity of action; such values must have been experienced and lived through an
action integrated within the world, before being grouped and systematized; what is
more, they cannot be completely systematized, because they lead to a plurality of

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT
AND OTHER SPECIES OF THOUGHT

217

different values, just as inductive theoretical knowledge leads to a plurality of prop­
erties of things and laws of the real. Theoretical and practical thought, which come
from technics, remain pluralistic because o f their inductive aspect. It is impossible
to say why there is one value for an action to be simple and easily accomplished,
and why there is another value for its efficiency; there is no analytical link between
ease and efficiency; and yet, there is a value for an action to be at once simple and
efficient. Only prior technical experience, really applied and integrated within the
hic et nunc , can provide the foundation of this pluralistic table o f values of practical
morality. Constituted in practical thought, they are no longer technical norms, but
proceed from the experience of technical action meeting with failure, and render­
ing explicit both its objective foundations in inductive theoretical knowledge and
its subjective foundations in norms o f practical morals.
The outcome of the split that occurs within religious thought, and which is the
correlate of the split that occurs within technics, opposes this pluralistic, inductive
and parceled aspect — which is pluralistic because it is empirical in its origin.
Religious thought also effectively splits into a theoretical mode and a practical
mode, when it becomes oversaturated to the point of incorporating too many sub­
jective and objective elements to be able to remain compatible with itself as a
mediation between man and the world; it is essentially a collective subjective that
religious thought incorporates, translating the structures of society in its exigency
for universal representation. Charged with social inferences, religious thought can
no longer realize a mediation between man and the world; it thus splits into a rep­
resentative exigency and a normative exigency, into a universal theological dogma
and a universal ethics. In these two specifications, it preserves what characterizes it
as religious thought, which is to say the demand for totality and for an uncondi­
tional unity given from the start.
Religious thought, like technical thought, effectively encounters limits to its
power, and these limits cannot be incorporated into its axiomatic. If religious
thought was applied to the world and to man without residue and without fis­
sure, then the function of the respect of totality that it represents would never be
challenged; but other dimensions of totality emerge besides those coming from
the reticulation of primitive magic; the individual tendencies, and above all the
social groupings that develop and structure themselves over time have powers of
totality that cannot be mediated. Each city brings its own vision of the world, its
unconditional imperatives. Delphi cannot always remain a neutral ground when
cities develop into empires; there are powers in the universe that don’t belong to
the ground aspects of the magical universe, and which are nevertheless also like

218

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

ground aspects. The oracle’s power encounters another power that is of the same
order, that ought to be compatible with it, and yet is not a part of primitive reli­
gious representation; it is a power that is not purely of ground; it has something
structural, it particularizes the vision of the world; a city is a totality, an empire
wants to be universal, and yet won’t be completely; religious thought thus splits
into theoretical and practical thought; while practical thought gives action a code,
theoretical thought seeks to render the qualities and forces of the world compatible
in a superior representation, grounding the Gscopia [theöria].
The theoretical knowledge that expresses religiosity seeks a systematic monistic
representation of the universe and o f man starting from the whole [le tout] in
order to go toward the part, and from the whole [l’ensemble] of time in order to
apprehend the instant in its particularity: it is monist and deductive, an essentially
contemplative knowledge, whereas the theoretical knowledge coming from tech­
nics is operational; this knowledge is contemplative in the sense that the subject is
in a situation o f inferiority and posteriority with respect to the reality that is to be
known; it doesn’t constitute it through successive gestures as inductive knowledge
does, by bringing order into an uncoordinated nature offering itself to his observa­
tion. For contemplative deductive knowledge, the effort of knowledge is only that
of becoming aware of an already existing order, not that of an effective ordering;
knowledge does not change being, and always remains partially insufficient for
grasping being, which is prior to it and at the heart of which knowledge deploys
itself like a reflection.
Indeed the use of number within the sciences appears to be of religious origin
rather than o f technical origin; indeed, number is basically structure that allows
deduction and allows the grasping of a particular reality in its reference to the
whole [ l’ensemble], so as to integrate itself within it; it is the number of the phi­
losophers, as defined by Plato who opposes the philosophical metretics to that of
the merchants, a pure practical procedure that does not facilitate knowledge of the
existence of the relations between beings, and between beings and the whole [le
tout], conceived as cosmos. The ideal numbers are the structures that enable the
relation of participation. Aristotle’s critique of the number-ideas in the Metaphysics
does not retain this eminently structural character of Plato’s number-ideas, because
Aristotle, following the schemas of inductive thinking, considers numbers through
the operation of numbering; however, theoretical thought that makes use of num­
bers is essentially contemplative and of religious origin. It does not seek to count
or measure beings, but to estimate what they are in their essence in relation to the
totality of the world; this is why it seeks the essential structure of each particular

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT
AND OTHER SPECIES OF THOUGHT

219

thing within number. Religious thought, characterized by the function of totality
and monist inspiration, is the second source of theoretical knowledge. It must be
noted that its intention is to grasp universal figurai realities, an order of the world,
an economy of the whole [le tout] of being; in this quest, it is metaphysical and not
physical, because it does not aim (as technical thought does by dissociating itself)
at an inductive accumulation of local ground realities, powers or (ptioeiç [physeis]\
it seeks the universal structural lines, the figure of the whole [le tout]. One can thus
suppose that research coming from the deductive source of theoretical knowledge
will never be able to meet the results of inductive research completely, since these
approaches are grounded, one upon a ground reality and the other upon a figurai
reality.
Religious thought gives rise to an ethics of obligation at the level of the practi­
cal order, starting from a given unconditional principle and descending from this
principle to the particular rules; there is an analogy between theoretical monism
and the practical monism of forms of thought governed by religion; the order
of the world cannot be other than, what it is; it is the opposite o f virtuality; it is
an actuality prior to all coming-into-being: the modality of deductive theoretical
knowledge is necessity. The unconditional and unique aspect of the imperative in
the practical realm, i.e., its categorical aspect, is what corresponds to the theoretical
modality of necessity; this imperative orders. The way in which Kant presents the
categorical imperative would be appropriate for defining the principle of ethics
arising out of religion if Kant hadn’t attached the categorical imperative to the
universality of reason; the categorical religious imperative is categorical prior to
being rational; it is everything at once, because the totality o f being pre-exists all
particular action and infinitely surpasses it, just as reality envelops the particular
being who is the subject of moral action. The categorical character of the moral
imperative translates the demand for totality, and the omnipotence of this demand
in relation to the particularity of the being who acts; the categorical imperative is
above all a respect for totality; it consists of the given and self-justifying character
of ground reality. What the moral subject respects in the categorical imperative is
the real as a totality that infinitely exceeds it, conditioning and justifying its action
because it contains it; all particular action is taken from totality, and deploys itself
on the ground of being and finds its normativity within it. It does not construct
and does not modify it: it can only apply itself and conform to it. Here lies the
second source of ethics, opposing itself to the technical source.
It can be said that there are two sources of theoretical thought and two sources
of practical thought: technics and religion, taken at the moment in which they split

220

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

because they are oversaturated and both have once again found a ground content
and a figurai content. Theoretical thought gathers both the ground content of
technics and the figurai content o f religions: it thus becomes both inductive and
deductive, operational and contemplative; practical thought gathers the figurai
content of technics and the ground content of religions, which provide it with
both hypothetical norms and categorical norms, pluralism and monism.
A complete knowledge and a complete morality would be [found] at the point
of convergence of the modes o f thought coming from these two opposing sources
in the theoretical order and in the practical order. However, what appears between
these opposing exigencies is more of a conflict than a discovery of unity: neither
theoretical thought nor practical thought succeeds in completely discovering a
content that would truly be at the intersection between these two basic directions.
Yet these directions act like normative powers by defining unique modalities that
are capable of existing judgment by judgment, act by act.
In the theoretical order, this synthetic median modality is that o f reality; the real
is not what is primarily given; it is that in which the encounter between induc­
tive knowledge and deductive knowledge would occur; it is the foundation of the
possibility o f this encounter, and the correlative foundation of the compatibility
of a pluralist knowledge and a monist knowledge; the real is the synthesis of the
virtual and the necessary, or rather the foundation of their compatibility; between
inductive pluralism and deductive pluralism, it is the stability of the figure-ground
relation taken as a complete reality.
Correlatively, in the practical order between the optative modality of practical
thought coming from technics and the categorical imperative, there is the central
moral category, situated at the intersection between the optative and obligation,
between the pluralism of practical values and the monism of the categorical imper­
ative; this modality has not received a name, because only the extreme terms have
been noticed (hypothetical imperative and categorical imperative); yet in the prac­
tical order it corresponds to reality in the theoretical order; it aims at the optimum
of action, by implicating a possible plurality of values and the unity of a norm of
compatibility. The optimum is a character of action that renders the plurality of
values and the unconditional demand for totality compatible. The optimum of
action postulates a possible convergence of the hypothetical imperatives and the
categorical imperative, and it constitutes this compatibility, just as the discovery
of the structures of the real renders inductive pluralism compatible with deductive
monism.

RELATIONS BETWEEN TECHNICAL THOUGHT

221

One could say that theoretical thought and practical thought constitute them­
selves insofar as they realize a convergence toward the neutral center, finding once
more an analog of primitive magical thought. However, theoretical unity and prac­
tical unity, postulated by the existence of two median modalities of theoretical
judgment and practical judgment (reality and optimum of action), allow for a
hiatus to subsist between the theoretical order and the practical order; the primitive
rupture dissociating the magical unity into figure and ground has been replaced
by the bimodal character of thought, divided into theoretical and practical. Each
mode, theory and practice, has figure and ground; but it is only together that they
gather the complete heritage of primitive magical thought, the complete mode of
mans being in the world. In order for the divergence within the coming-into-being
of thought to be fully compensated, the distance between the theoretical order
and the practical order would have to be overcome by a type of thinking that has
a definitive capacity of synthesis, and is able to present itself as a functional analog
of magic, and then of aesthetic activity; in other words, the work that aesthetic
thought accomplishes at the level ,of the primitive opposition between technics
and religion would have to be carried out anew at the level of the relation between
theoretical and practical thought. This work is what philosophical reflection must
fulfill [accomplir].
Now, in order for this philosophical work to be carried out [s'accomplir] the
basis of this reflection must be firm and complete: in other words, the genesis
of theoretical and practical forms of thought must be fully and completely ful­
filled, so that the sense of the relation to be constituted can emerge. Philosophical
thought, so as to be able to play its role o f convergence, must first of all become
aware of previous geneses, in order to grasp the modalities in their true signifi­
cation, in order to be able to determine the true neutral center of philosophical
thought; theoretical thought and practical thought are effectively always imper­
fect and incomplete; it is their intention and their direction that one must grasp;
this direction [direction], however, and this intention would not result from an
examination of the actual content of each of these forms of thought; in order for
philosophical effort to find the direction in which it must exert itself, what must be
known is the direction [sens] of the coming-into-being of each form starting from
its very origins. Philosophical thought has to return to an originary grasping of the
coming-into-being at the end of which it (philosophical thought) intervenes as a
force of convergence. It can even operate a conversion of technical thought and
religious thought into relational modes before the dissociation that leads to the
emergence of theoretical thought and practical thought; nothing effectively proves

222

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

that a viable synthesis can be established between these forms of thought if there
isn’t a common basic area pre-existing the dissociation, and reconnecting aesthetic
thought to philosophy; this intermediate mode can be called culture; philosophy
would thus be constructive and regulative of culture, translating the sense [sens]
of religions and o f technics into cultural content. In particular, its task would be
to introduce new manifestations of technical thought and religious thought into
culture: thus, culture would occupy the neutral point, accompanying the genesis
of different forms o f thought and preserving the result of the exercise of forces of
convergence.
An effort of convergence can apply itself to recent forms of the elementary think­
ing of technics and of the thinking of totalities, the matrix of religions, because
these two types o f thought apply to the mediation, not only between the world and
individual man, but between the geographical world and the human world; these
two types of thought have human reality as their object, and elaborate themselves
on the basis o f this new weight; they refract human reality into different direc­
tions [en des sens différents] : this commonality of object can serve as a basis for the
edification o f a culture via the intermediary of philosophical reflection; there is a
technics of man and every technics is to a certain extent a technics of man within
a group, because man intervenes in the determination of the technical ensemble;
the saturation of technical activity can lead to a structuration other than that of
the fragmentation [éclatement] of thought into a theoretical mode and a practical
mode; philosophical thought can allow for technical thought to remain more fully
technical for a longer period o f time, so as to attempt to relate the two opposing
phases of man’s being in the world before the dissociation of technical thought and
religious thought; the task of philosophical thought would thus be to grasp afresh
this coming-into-being, which means to slow it down in order to deepen its mean­
ing and make it more fertile: the dissociation of fundamental phases of thought
into theoretical modes and practical modes is perhaps premature; philosophical
effort can preserve technicity and religiosity in order to discover their possible con­
vergence at the endpoint of a genesis that wouldn’t complete itself spontaneously
without the genetic intention of philosophical effort. Philosophy would thus not
only task itself with the discovery of genetic essences, but also their production.

The opposition that exists between technics and religions, in an initial stage, is
inherent to the technics of the natural world’s elaboration in the contrast they form
with those religions that think the destiny o f individual man. But there is a second
stage of technics and of religion: after the elaboration o f the natural world, tech­
nical thought turned itself toward the elaboration o f the human world, which it
analyzes and breaks down into elementary processes, and then reconstructs accord­
ing to operational schemas, preserving the figurai structures and setting aside the
qualities and ground forces. To these technics of the human world correspond
types of thought that also concern themselves with the human world, but taken
in its totality. They aren’t commonly called religions, because tradition reserves the
name of religion for modes of thought that are contemporary with the technics of
elaboration of the world; and yet, these modes of thought that assume the func­
tion of totality, in opposition with the technics applied to the human world, and
which are the great political movements possessing a global reach, are indeed the
functional analog of religions. But man’s technics and social and political thought
result from a new wave of splits [dédoublementy] within magical thought. The old
technics and religions were able to develop by taking advantage of the dissocia­
tion of the primitive magical universe considered almost exclusively as the natural
world; the human world remained enveloped by the primitive magical reticula­
tion. Conversely, from the moment at which the man’s technics broke away from
this reticulation, and began considering man as technical matter, what emerged

224

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

correlatively from this new break in the figure-ground relationship was a thinking
that grasps human beings from below the level of unity (the technics of human
management {m aniem ent ]) and another thinking grasping them from above the
level of unity (social and political thoughts). As with the old technics and old
religions that arose from out of the breaking of the natural world’s magical reticu­
lation, human technics and political thoughts proceed in opposite directions from
one another; technics apply themselves to man by means of figurai characteristics,
pluralizing and studying him as a citizen, as a worker, and as a member of a familial
community; it is indeed the figurai elements that are retained by technics, and
in particular criteria such as the integration into social groups, the cohesion of
groups; they transform attitudes into structural elements like socio-metrics does
when it transforms choices into the lines of the socio-gram. Rather than analyzing
man, social and political thought classifies and judges him by putting him into
categories defined by qualities and ground forces, just as religions classify and judge
by placing each individual into the category of the sacred or the profane, or the
pure or impure. And just as religions rebel against technics’ profanation of the
sacred aspect of certain places and moments, imposing respect for these places and
moments on technics by way o f prohibitions (for instance the observance of public
holidays), in the same way, social and political thoughts, even when they oppose
each other, limit the technics of man and oblige technics to respect his reality, as
if the technics o f man were impious and disrespectful to the totality. The human
world is thus represented in its elements by the technics of man and in its totality
by the social and political concerns; but these two representations are not enough,
because the human world can be grasped in its unity only at the neutral point;
technics pluralize it, and political thought integrates it into a higher unity, that of
the totality of humanity in its coming-into-being, where it loses its real unity in the
same way that the individual loses its unity within a group.
However, the true level of human reality’s individuation should be grasped by a
thought that would be the analog for the human world of what aesthetic thought
is for the natural world. This thought is not yet constituted, and it seems that it
is philosophical thought that must constitute it. Aesthetic activity can be consid­
ered an implicit philosophy, but although aesthetic thought can apply itself to the
human world, it seems unlikely that it would suffice to establish a stable and com­
plete relation between man’s technics and social and political thought. Indeed, this
construction cannot be isolated because the human world is attached to the natural
world. Man’s technics emerged as a separate technics the moment when the technics
of the elaboration of the natural world modified the social and political regimes

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

225

through their rapid development. It is thus not only between mans technics and
social and political thought that the relation must be established, but between all
the elementary functions and all the functions of the whole [les fonctions d ’ensemble\, including the technics of man and the technics of the world, religious thought
and social and political thought. Philosophical thought is appropriate for such an
elaboration, because it can know the coming-into-being o f the different forms of
thought and establish a relation between the successive stages of genesis, in par­
ticular between the stage that carries out [,accomplit] the break within the magical
natural universe and the stage that carries out the dissociation within the magical
human universe, and which is in the process o f completing itself. Conversely, aes­
thetic thought is contemporary with each splitting into two even if it were possible
to create a new aesthetics between man’s technics and social and political thinking,
a philosophical thinking, an aesthetics of aesthetics, would be required in order to
attach these two successive aesthetics to each other. Philosophy would thus consti­
tute the high neutral point of the coming-into-being of thought.
The philosophical effort thus finds itself faced with a unique task to be accom­
plished: the search for unity among the technical and non-technical modes of
thought; but this task can take two different paths.
The first path would consist in preserving aesthetic activity as a model, and to
attempt to bring about an aesthetics o f the human world, so that the technics of the
human world may encounter the functions of totality of this world, the concern
with which is the animating force behind social and political thought. The second
path would consist not in taking up technics nor those thoughts that assume the
functions of totality in their original state, but rather only after their splitting into
a theoretical mode and a practical mode, united in science and ethics. Now, the
second path, which takes a longer detour, corresponds indeed to philosophical
research, according to tradition as well as to the demands of a problematic; but it
seems, within the current state of notions and methods, to lead to an impasse, to
the point that Kant sought to distinguish the two domains of the theoretical and
the practical, assigning an independent status to each of them. Already Descartes
had sought to found [fonder] a provisional moral code, prior to the completion of
theoretical knowledge. It can be asked whether the insoluble aspect of this prob­
lem of the relation between science and ethics does not rather come from the fact
that science and ethics are not true, perfectly coherent and unified syntheses, but
a rather unstable compromise between what technical thought contributes and
what religious thought contributes, which is to say between the demands of the
knowledge of elements and of that of the functions of totality. In this case, one

226

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

should rethink at its basis the genesis of the modes of thought, in the phase shift
that opposes technics and religion, prior to the split that, within both technics and
religion, leads to the emergence of the theoretical mode and the practical mode:
philosophical thought, reflecting on technics and religion could perhaps discover a
reflexive technology and an inspiration coming from religion which would directly
and completely coincide with one another, rather than creating an intermediary
space o f incomplete and precarious relation, such as the one grounded in aesthetic
activity.
This relation would be at once theoretical and practical, taken prior to the split
into the theoretical mode and the practical mode. It would really and completely
fulfill the role that aesthetic activity only partially fulfills, seeking to integrate tech­
nics and religion (here social and political thought is considered as being of the
same order as religion, and capable o f being treated like it) into a unique world that
is both natural and human. For this integration to be possible, technical thought
and religious thought would have to be at the level of unity, and no longer lower
or higher than unity: the structures o f plurality and of totality would have to be
replaced by a network of analogically connected units.
The condition for this discovery is a deepening of the sense of technics and of
the sense of religion that would lead to a reticular structuration of technics and
religion. Technics and religion can coincide, not in the continuity of their content,
but through a certain number of singular points belonging to both areas, and by
establishing a third area through their coincidence, which is that of cultural reality.
Technical thought can be structured by the discovery of broader schemas than
those of use in a determinate area. The pluralism o f technics effectively results not
only from the diversity of technical objects, but also from the human diversity of
trades and areas of use. Technical objects with a wide variety of uses can have ana­
logical schemas; the true elementary unity of the technical reality is not the practical
object, but the concretized technical individual. It is possible to discover truly pure
technical schemas (like those of the different modes of causality, conditioning, and
command) through a reflection on these concretized technical individuals.
The reflexive effort applied to technics is characterized by the fact that a tech­
nics of all technics can develop through the generalization of schemas. Just as the
pure sciences are defined, one can imagine founding a pure technics, or a general
technology that would be very different from the theoretical sciences whose appli­
cations are translated into technics; it is indeed correct that a discovery in the area
of the sciences can enable the birth of new technical devices [dispositifi]; but it is
not directly, by deduction, that a scientific discovery becomes a technical device:

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

227

scientific discovery provides new conditions for technical research, but the effort of
invention must nevertheless be exerted for the technical object to appear; in other
words, scientific thought must become an operational schema or the basis for oper­
ational schemas. What one could call a pure technology resides, on the contrary, at
the intersection of several sciences and traditional technical areas distributed among
several occupations. Thus the schemas of circular action and their diverse regimes
are not the property of any specific technics; they were first noticed and concep­
tually defined within the technics related to the transmission of information and
automatism, because they play an important practical role within them, but even
before this, they had already played a role within technics such as thermal engine
technology, and Maxwell had already studied them theoretically. And yet, every
thought whose content covers a plurality of technics, or at the very least applies to
an open plurality of technics, exceeds for that very reason the technical domain.
Certain processes included within the functioning of the nervous system can be
thought of through schemas of recurrent causality as well as certain natural phe­
nomena; the schema of relaxation for instance is always identical to itself, whether
it is applied to a technical apparatus, to the functioning of an intermittent fountain
or to the phenomenon of trembling in Parkinsons disease. A general theory of
causalities and of conditionings exceeds the specificity o f a domain, even if the
conceptual origins of this theory come from a particular technics. The schemas of a
generalized technology therefore rise above the distinct technical object; in partic­
ular, they allow for adequately thinking the relation between technical objects and
the natural world, which is to say they allow for the assurance of the integration
of technics into the world in a way that goes beyond empiricism. The technical
object, placed into the middle of a body [faisceau] of actions and reactions whose
interplay is predicted and can be calculated, is no longer that object separated from
the world, resulting from a break within the primitive structuration of the magical
world; the figure-ground relation, broken by technical objectivation, is once again
found within general technology; because of this, the technical object is invented
according to the milieu into which it must be integrated, and the particular techni­
cal schema reflects and integrates the characteristics of the natural world; technical
thought extends itself by incorporating the demands and the mode of being of the
milieu associated with the technical individual.
Thus, to the extent that a polytechnic technology replaces the separate technics,
the technical realities themselves, in their realized objectivity, take on a network
structure; they are related to one another, rather than being self-sufficient like works
by artisans, and they are in relation to the world which they bind into the mesh of

228

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

their key-points: tools are free and abstract, always transportable everywhere one
goes, but technical ensembles are true networks concretely attached to the natural
world; a dam cannot be built just anywhere, nor can a solar furnace. Some notions
o f traditional culture appear to suppose that the development of technics causes
the disappearance of the particular aspect of each place and region, leading to the
loss of customs and local artisanal inflections; in reality, technical development
creates a far more important and much more firmly rooted concretization than
the one it destroys; an artisanal custom, like a regional costume, can, by simple
influence, be transported from one place to another; it is only rooted in the human
world; conversely, a technical ensemble is profoundly rooted in the natural milieu.
There are no coal mines in primary terrains.
So it is that some high points of the natural, technical, and human world are
constituted; it is the ensemble, the interconnection of these high points that makes
this polytechnic — both natural and human — universe; the structures of this
reticulation become social and political. In existence, technics are separate neither
for the natural world nor for the human world. And yet, for technical thought,
they remain as if they were separate due to the fact that no thought has been
sufficiently developed in order to allow for the theorization of this reticulation of
concrete technical ensembles. This theorization is the task that befalls philosophical
thought, for there is a new reality here that is not yet represented in culture. Beyond
the technical determinations and norms, one would have to discover polytechnic
and technological determinations and norms. A world of the plurality of technics
exists that has its own structures, and which ought to find representations within
the content of culture would be adequate to it; the general term network, com­
monly employed to designate the interconnecting structures of electrical energy,
telephones, railways, and roads, is far too imprecise and does not account for the
particular regimes o f causality and conditioning that exist in these networks, and
that functionally attach them to the human world and to the natural world, as a
concrete mediation between these two worlds.
The introduction of adequate representations of technical objects into culture
would result in the key-points of technical networks becoming real terms of ref­
erence for the ensemble of human groups, whereas they currently are only key
terms for those who understand them, which is to say for the technicians of each
specialty; for other men, they only have a practical value, and correspond to very
confused concepts; technical ensembles introduce themselves into the world as if
they had no natural or human right of belonging, while a mountain or promon­
tory, which have less concrete regulatory power than some technical ensembles, are
known by all men of a region and belong to the representation of the world.

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

229

And yet, one can wonder to what extent the creation of a general technology
brings technics closer to religion; the recognition o f the genuine [véritable ] com­
plex operational schemas and of the integration o f technical ensembles would not
be enough to enable this rapprochement if there weren’t, along with a theoreti­
cal awareness of processes also a normative value contained in them. Indeed, the
reticular structures of integrated technics are no longer mere means available for
an action and abstractly transportable anywhere, utilizable at any moment; one
changes tools and instruments, one can construct or repair a tool oneself, but one
cannot change the network, one doesn’t construct a network of one’s own: one can
only connect to a network, adapt to it, participate in it; the network dominates
and frames [enserre] the action of the individual, it even dominates each technical
ensemble. Whence a form of participation in the natural world and in the human
world that gives an incorruptible collective normativity to technical activity; it is no
longer only a slightly abstract solidarity of trades as evoked by Sully Prudhomme
(the solidarity of specialists, the bricklayer, the baker), but an extremely concrete
and actual solidarity, existing instant by instant throughout the interplay of mul­
tiple conditionings; through the technical networks, the human world acquires a
high degree of internal resonance. The powers, forces, and potentials that drive
toward action exist in the reticular technical world in the same way in which they
might have existed in the primitive magical universe: technicity is a part of the
world, it is not only an ensemble of means, but an ensemble of conditionings of
action and of incitements to act; the tool or instrument doesn’t have normative
power because it is permanently available to the individual; technical networks take
on more normative power as the internal resonance of human activity throughout
technical realities becomes greater.
However, the valorization of technical ensembles and their normative value
entail a very particular form of respect, which has in view pure technicity in itself.
It is this form of respect, founded on the knowledge of technical reality, and not
on the prestige of the imagination, which can penetrate culture. A large highway,
at the edge of a big city, imposes this form of respect; moreover, a harbor, the rail
traffic signal regulation center, or the control tower of an aerodrome impose this
same form of respect: the key-points of a network possess this power, insofar as
they are key-points, and not because of the direct prestige of the technical objects
they contain. So it was that the clock o f the Paris Observatory, about ten years ago,
was slightly disrupted by the tumultuous visit of science students passing by it on
their way to the catacombs; the uproar caused by this violation of the technical
sacred was, at that moment, rather considerable. Now if that same clock had been

230

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

placed in a teaching laboratory, and it had been intentionally set wrong in order to
show the interplay of the self-regulation o f its functioning, then no emotion corre­
sponding to the violation of the sacred would have been felt; it is in fact because the
Observatory’s clock is the key point o f a network (it emits the time signals by radio)
that its disturbance is scandalous; it is not because of the practical danger that this
disturbance would have represented, because it is too small to be severe enough
to lead to important errors by ships on sea. Here we bear witness to a profanation
properly speaking, independent of the practical consequences it could entail; it is
the stability o f a system o f references that is compromised. It is likely, by the way,
that to have attempted such a profanation would not have occurred to humanities
students, since for them the Observatory’s clock doesn’t have the same normative
value; it is not sacred, because it is not known according to its technical essence,
and is not represented by adequate concepts in their culture. These forms of respect
and o f disrespect manifest, within the technicity that is integrated into the natural
and human world, the inherence o f values surpassing utility; thought that recog­
nizes the nature o f technical reality is that which, going beyond separate objects
— utensils — according to Heidegger’s expression, discovers the essence and reach
of technical organization, beyond separate objects and specialized occupations.
Traditional religious thought seems to find a means of becoming aware of itself
in an attitude of struggle against new technics. In fact, it is not technics themselves
that are targeted, but the type of civilization that is contemporary to these technics
and that abandons not only their traditional religions, but also the old technics
that were their contemporaries. This opposition is distorted at its very foundation
because current technics should be coupled to social and political thoughts, and
not to religions, which are not their contemporaries. It is only after the realization
of the coupling of technics and religions of the same era that the continuity of
successive stages can be perceived, but not by way o f the opposition of the phase of
one era with that of another.
If one considers the social and political thoughts of our time, which are con­
temporary to the recent development of technics, it can be seen that they bring
religion’s aspect of absolute universality down to a dimension that conforms to an
integration into the natural and human world; every social and political doctrine
no doubt tends to present itself as an absolute, as unconditionally valid, beyond
the hic et nunc, social and political thought, nevertheless, accepts positing current
and concrete problems; in the same way as technical thought being developed
does, social and political thought leads to a reticular representation of the world,
with key-points and essential moments; it applies to technical reality by treating

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

231

it as more than a simple means, and indeed grasps technical reality at the level of
the reticulation of integration into the natural and human world. Three important
recent social and political doctrines have thus incorporated, each in an original
way, a representation and valorization o f integrated technics; National Socialist
thought is attached to a certain conception linking the destiny of a people to a
technical expansion, even thinking the role of neighboring peoples as a function of
this master expansion; the American democratic doctrine has a certain definition
of technical progress and of its incorporation into civilization; the notion of the
standard of living, which is a social one, and constitutes a cultural reality, has a con­
tent wherein important terms are technological (not only the possession of this or
that instrument or utensil, but the fact o f knowing how to use this or that network,
of knowing how to be functionally connected). The Communist Marxist doctrine
finally, in its lived and realized aspects, considers technical development to be an
essential aspect of the social and political effort to be made; it gains self-awareness
through the use of tractors, the foundation of factories. At the political level, the
self-awareness the great nations have of themselves contains a representation not
only of their technical level (which would only be an estimation of power), but
of their integration through the intermediary of technical reality into the entire
current universe. A change in technics entails a modification of what one could call
the political constellation of the universe: the key-points move on the surface of
the world; coal is less important today than at the dawn of the Great War; but oil
is more important. These structures are more stable than the economic structures
that govern them: despite a great number of economical modifications, certain pas­
sageways toward mineral resources have remained stable since the times o f Roman
conquest. Social and political thought becomes integrated into the world accord­
ing to a certain number of outstanding points, problematic points that coincide
with the points of integration of technicity envisaged as a network.
By this we do not mean to say that social and political structures limit them­
selves to expressing the state of the economy which is itself determined by the
state of technicity, what we mean to say is that the distribution and integration of
key-points of social and political thought in the world at least partially coincides
with the distribution and integration of the technical key-points, and that this
coinciding becomes all the more perfect as technics becomes increasingly inte­
grated within the universe, in the form of fixed ensembles, attached to one another,
constraining [enserrant] human individuals into the links they determine.

232

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

However, such a formal rapprochement of the structures of political thought
and of technical thought cannot resolve the problem of the relationship of tech­
nics with forms of non-technical thought. It is effectively at the price of a certain
renouncement of universality that social and political thought manages to make
its structures coincide with those of technical thought, and particularly of tech­
nical thought applied to the human world; social and political thought manages
to coincide well enough with the representations of commerce, with import and
export, in other words with economic realities that are the result of the existence
of technics, but which translate the manner in which technics are used by human
groups; these modes of utilization of technics by human groups are themselves
subject to technics that no longer apply to the natural world, but rather to the
human world, and that don’t produce technical objects or technical ensembles,
unless one can consider the means of advertising or the retail organizations as such.
Currently, it could therefore be said that the agreement between technical thought
and non-technical thought is only possible at the price of very great simplification
and abstraction, as much in the technical domain as in the non-technical domain.
On the one hand, this simplification essentially consists in establishing a break
between the technics of the natural world and the technics of the human world,
and on the other hand, in a break between religious thought and social and polit­
ical thought. Through this rupture, by virtue of the abandonment of the technical
demands o f the natural world, the technics of the human world, rather than being
constrained to remain within an elementary plurality, below a true unity, could
think that they grasp a true unity in the generality of groups, of the crowd, and of
public opinion; in reality, they continue to apply elementary thought to general
realities, for instance, by studying the mass m edia 7 as if they were distinct from the
concrete reality of the groups in which they operate; the rupture between figure
and ground subsists in the technics of the human world, and it is even particularly
obvious, but it goes unperceived in the implementation of technics, because these
technics, in order to act, seek precisely what one could call the ground figures,
namely those that are the least formalized and the least institutionalized. Despite
this aspect, they nevertheless remain figurai realities, and not a whole and complete
reality.
This same insufficiency manifests itself within socio-political thought which
remains the intermediary between the true consideration of totalities, characteriz­
ing real religious thought, non-politicized or socialized by the influence of a group,
and the mythological application to the expression of the necessities of a moment

233

or a group: it is generally the mythology o f a group that is erected as a universalizable doctrine; because of its claim to universality, of that which is only universal in
regard to its origins and intent, social and political thinking is a combat thinking.
Henceforth, it becomes easy to understand why the distance between the tech­
nics of human management and social and political thought is not so great: a
political movement can use the technics of advertising converted into means for
propaganda, just as a definite technics of human management leads to a social
and political option. But this encounter, this mutual complicity, can only exist at
the price of abandoning fidelity to the elementary functions, characterizing true
technicity, and the correlative abandonment o f the mission to represent the func­
tions of totality characteristic of religious thought. The alliance o f an ensemble of
procedures and of a mythology is not the encounter of technicity and of respect
with regard to totality.
This is why philosophical thought must maintain the continuity that exists
between the successive stages of technical thought and religious thought, all the
way to social and political thinking. Technicity must be maintained starting with
the technics applied to the natural world all the way up to including those address­
ing the human world, just as the concern with totality must be maintained starting
from religions and progressing all the way up to including social and political
thought. Without this continuity, without this real unity o f the coming-into-being
of technics and of the thoughts related to the function of totality, a false dialogue
is established between the forms relating to the natural world and those relating
to the human world; for instance, the technics of human management are only an
additional variable within industrial technics (scientific m anagem ent ),8 or else tradi­
tional religious thought chooses a current social and political thinking that adopts
the worldview closest to it, and thereby deprives itself of its power of universality.
Because of its object, this study does not propose to deal with the problem
of establishing continuity between the religious and social and political forms of
thought; it must nevertheless deal with this problem insofar as this effort is sym­
metrical with the effort by which the technics of the world must be brought closer
to those of man.
And yet, if the technics of man fail in their function of the analysis of elements,
and act generally through empirical procedures (which is what statistical concep­
tualism expresses, developing within a comfortable nominalism), this is because
they accept detaching themselves from the real object, the element, individual,
or ensemble. There can be no true technics separate from the human world; the

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

technics o f the human world must have an objective material, they cannot be
purely psychological, lest they become procedures, in other words, it is by way of
an enlargement o f technical ensembles comprising an integration into both the
natural world and the human world that one can subsequently act upon the human
world, that is, through, and according to, this natural and human ensemble: as
mediation between the natural world and the human world, technical thought can
act upon the human world only via the intermediary of this mediation. Human
reality can be the object of technics only when it is already engaged within a tech­
nical relation. There is no legitimate technics other than that of technical reality;
technical thought must develop the network o f relational points between man and
the world, by becoming a technology, which is to say, a second degree technics that
deals with organizing these relational points. But there cannot be any legitimate
application of technical thought into a non-technical reality, for instance into what
one could call the natural and spontaneous human world: technology can only
develop within an already technical reality. Reflexive thought must promote tech­
nology, but it mustn’t attempt to apply technical schemas and procedures outside
the domain of technical reality.
To put it another way, it is not human reality (and in particular that which in
human reality can be modified, namely culture: the active intermediary between
successive generations, the concurrent [simultanés] human groups and successive
or concurrent individuals) that must be incorporated into technics as a workable
material; it is culture, considered as a lived totality, that must incorporate the tech­
nical ensembles by knowing their nature, in order to be able to regulate human life
according to these technical ensembles. Culture must remain above all technics,
but it must incorporate into its content the knowledge and intuition of genuine
technical schemas. Culture is that through which man regulates his relation with
the world and with himself; and yet if culture were not to incorporate technology,
it would contain an opaque zone and wouldn’t be able to contribute its regulative
normativity to the coupling of man and the world. For in this coupling of man
and the world, which is that of technical ensembles, there are schemas of activity
and conditioning that can be clearly thought only by virtue of concepts defined by
a reflexive but direct study. Culture must be contemporary with technics. Culture
must reshape itself [se reformer] and must once again take up its content stage by
stage. If culture is only traditional, then it is false, because it implicitly and spon­
taneously contains a regulative representation of technics of a certain era; and it
falsely brings this regulative representation into a world to which it cannot apply.
Therefore, the confusion of technical realities with utensils is a cultural stereotype,

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

235

founded on the normative notion of utility that is at once valorizing and devaluing.
But this notion of utensil and of utility is inadequate to the effective and actual
role of technical ensembles within the human world; it thus cannot be regulative
in an effective way.
Deprived of the contribution of cultural regulation, which passes through the
intermediary of an adequate representation o f technical realities, this coupling of
man and the world develops in isolation, in a non-integrated, anomical manner.
As a counterpoint, this development of technical realities enveloping man without
regulation justifies, at least apparently, cultures implicit mistrust o f technics; a
self-justifying culture develops in human milieus promoting a technics, while gen­
eral culture becomes inhibiting, but not regulative, o f all technics.
Now, the philosophical and notional awareness o f technical reality is necessary
for the creation of a cultural content incorporating technics, but it is not enough.
Nothing effectively proves that technical reality can be adequately known through
concepts; conceptual knowledge can indeed designate and cover technical real­
ity at the level of separate technical objects, which can be classified according to
structures and usages. But only with great difficulty can it lead into knowledge of
technical ensembles. To acquire this knowledge, the human being must really be
put into a situation, since it is a mode of existence that he must experience. The
tool, instrument, or isolated machine can be perceived by a subject who remains
detached from them. But the technical ensemble cannot be grasped by intuition,
for it cannot be considered a detached, abstract, or m anipulate object at man’s
disposal. It corresponds to an experience o f existence [épreuve] and a situation, it is
tied by reciprocal action with the subject.
In the same way one used to consider journeys as a means for acquiring culture,
because they constituted a mode of placing man into a situation, one should also
consider the technical experiences of being placed into a situation with respect
to an ensemble, with effective responsibility, as having cultural value. To put it
another way, every human being should to a certain extent take part in technical
ensembles, that is, take on a responsibility, a definite task with respect to such an
ensemble and be connected with a network of universal technics. Furthermore,
individual man should not simply experience a single kind of technical ensemble,
but rather a plurality of them, just as a traveler will have to encounter several peo­
ples, and experience their mores.
However, this kind of experience must be conceived more as a way of experi­
encing the situating of each type of technics and ensemble of technics, than as an
effort to participate in the condition of man in each of the technics: for in each

236

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

technics there are technicians, unskilled laborers, workers, managers, and to the
extent that conditions are strictly social, they can be rather analogous, at each level,
in the different technics. It is the particular situating in the technical network that
must be experienced, insofar as it places man in the presence of and within a series
o f actions and processes that he does not direct alone, but in which he participates.
The philosopher, comparable in this role to the artist, can help in raising aware­
ness o f the situation within the technical ensemble, by reflecting it within himself
and by expressing it; but, again just as the artist, all he can do is be the one who
solicits an intuition in others, once a definite sensitivity has been awakened and
allows the grasping of the sense o f a real experience.
However, we must note that art, as a means of expression and as awakening of
the cultural awareness of technical ensembles, is limited; art goes through aïo0r|Gtç
[afsthësis] and is therefore naturally inclined to grasp the object, tool, instrument,
or machine; but true technicity, that which can be integrated into culture, is not
in the manifest. All the prestigious color photographs of sparks, of fumes, all the
recordings of noise, sounds, or images, generally remain a use [exploitation] of tech­
nical reality and not a revelation of this reality. Technical reality must be thought,
and even be known through participation in its schemas of action; aesthetic feeling
can emerge, but only after this intervention of real intuition and participation and
not as a fruit of a mere spectacle: every technical spectacle remains puerile and
incomplete if it is not preceded by the integration into the technical ensemble.
The intuitions of technical participation, however, are not opposed to the forces
and qualities of religious and social and political thought. Social and political
thought is continuous with respect to religious thought when it is not an actual
and already realized totality properly speaking (for totality is what it is, it is an
absolute and cannot push toward action), but instead is the latency of broader
ensembles undergirding actual structures, and the validity of this announcement
of new structures; social and political thought expresses the relation of totality with
respect to the part, of virtual totality with respect to the actual part. It expresses
the function of relative totality, whereas religions express the function of absolute
totality, and it expresses the function of virtual totality, whereas religions express
the function of actual totality. And yet, there can be a complementary relation
between the intuitions of integration into technical ensembles and social and polit­
ical intuitions, because technical intuitions express the result of history and of the
conditioning of life, of the hic et nunc , whereas the social and political intuitions
are a project going toward the future, the active expression of potentials. Social
and political thoughts are the expression of tendencies and forces that exceed all

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

237

actual given structure; the intuitions relating to technical ensembles express what
humanity has done, what is done, and what is structured because done, accom­
plished. Figurai power can thus remain invested in technics and ground power in
social and political thought, insofar as figurai reality is what is given in the system
of actuality whereas ground power contains potentials and keeps the becoming in
reserve. While impossible at the level of the relation between elementary technical
objectivity and universal religious thought, the relation once more becomes possi­
ble when it establishes itself between technical ensembles, which is the expression
of actuality, and social and political thought, which is the expression of virtuality.
There is a compatibility between actuality and virtuality through the real coming-into-being, whose meaning [sens] is stretched taught between this actuality and
this virtuality. Philosophical thought grasps the correlation between actuality and
virtuality, and it maintains it by establishing the coherence o f this relation.
It is thus the sense [sens] of coming-into-being, the ability of technics to engen­
der the coming-into-being of both the natural and the human world, that makes
elementary intuition and the intuition of the ensemble compatible; technical
intuition, at the level of ensembles, expresses coming-into-being as both basis and
result obtained; social and political intuition is the integration of tendencies, the
expression of virtualités and forces o f coming-into-being, in the same reality. At
the level of technical thought attached to tools, and of universalizing religious
thought, there cannot be any direct encounter between the two types of thought,
because the mediation of coming-into-being is not possible; each tool, each sep­
arate technics that is capable o f manipulating tools present themselves as stable
and definitive. Universalizing religious thought also presents itself as stable and
definitive, with reference to an atemporal ground. Conversely, the introduction of
technicity to ensembles which situate man as organizer or as element makes tech­
nics evolve; to the same extent and at the same time, the evolving aspect of human
groups becomes conscious and this consciousness creates socio-political thought.
Both born from coming-into-being, one expressing the definite past serving as its
basis and the other the possible future serving as its goal, the technical thought of
ensembles and social and political thought are coupled through their conditions of
origin and their points of integration into the world.
Thus it is within the perspective of permanent change within technical and
socio-political structures that technical thought and socio-political thought can
coincide. Elementary technicity, the one that animates the thought o f artisans, and
religiosity with a universal basis, the one that is contemporary with the first devel­
opment of technics, can serve as paradigm for thinking the coming-into-being of

238

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

technical ensembles and for thinking the coming-into-being of totalities; without
the norm of elementary technics and that of universal religiosity, the technical
thought o f ensembles in a process of coming-into-being and the social and political
thought of evolving communities would lose their reciprocal tension; the thought
of technical ensembles needs to be inspired by that of elements, and that of the
coming-into-being of the human world by the function of totality, in order for
these two forms of thought, which must meet analogically but which must not be
confused with each other, to preserve their autonomy and not enslave one another.
Because the functional totality of thought coming from the primitive relation with
the world must be maintained by the real bipolarity of the primitive phase shift’s
results; culture is directed by this bipolarity; it develops between technical thought
and religious thought; it is culture that links the lived understanding [<compréhen­
sion] of the technicity of ensembles with that o f the human groups represented in
socio-political thought.
The past — i.e., the first forms of technical thought and of religious thought, at
the level of the first splitting in two o f magical thought, as well as aesthetic activity
placed at the neutral point o f this first split — must be preserved as cultural con­
tent, i.e., as a foundation for providing the norms for current thought, but it is only
as cultural content that they must be preserved; it would be a transgression \faute]
against coming-into-being to want to substitute the representation of elements,
tools or instruments for that of the current technicity of ensembles; for technicity,
in its current lived reality, no longer simply resides at the level of elements, but
also and essentially at the level of ensembles; today ensembles are depositaries of
technicity in the same way that the fragmentation into elements had been prior to
this; thought must start from the knowledge of the technicity of elements, re-situated in the past, in order to grasp the technicity of ensembles in their reality, for
it effectively results from it: thought must go from the cultural to the actual in
order to understand the actual in its reality. Furthermore, religious thought is a
permanent reminder of the sense o f totality, and culture must renew the rootedness
of socio-political thought in universalized religious thought, proceeding from the
cultural to the virtual, in order to grasp and promote the virtual in its value.
Now, the non-cultural in technics is the uniqueness of each determinate tech­
nics, tending to impose its norms, schemas, and particular vocabulary; technics, in
order to be grasped in their real essence which alone is cultural, must be presented
and experienced as a cluster \faisceati\ of plurality; this plurality is a part of the
technical condition, which grasps the elements. Religious thought, inversely, must
be seized as unconditional unity, in itself; what is contrary to culture, in religions,

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

239

is their possible plurality, which is to say the confrontation o f determinate religious
traditions; and yet, since religions, as traditions, are necessarily rooted, culture must
create a superstructure on the basis of which the different religions appear in their
unity as religions; it is the meaning [sens] o f ecumenism, which is the condition of
the integration of religions into culture, the condition o f religions’ fecundity in the
direction [sens] of culture; it is perhaps uncertain whether there really can be open
religions, or whether the opposition between closed religions and open religions is
as clear as the one Bergson establishes; but the openness of religions is a function
that is common to different religions, each to a certain extent closed in on itself.
It was hardly possible for ecumenism to be constructed in a distant past, for
it can constitute itself only by means of a reflexive thinking wanting to ground
culture; it is essentially, and in itself, philosophical work; it necessitates becoming
aware of the deep sense of religions, which can occur only by re-situating them
within the coming-into-being of thought on the basis of primitive magic. To this
day, limited ecumenisms (as within Christianity) have arisen, but it is a universal
ecumenism that philosophical reflection must develop so that religious reality inte­
grates itself into culture.
The institution of a technology has the same signification as that of ecumenism,
but its consequence is making one grasp the true elementary particularity of tech­
nical objects, on the basis of a general normalization o f the common vocabulary
and notions, replacing the false specificity of trade terms, caused by use and not
by the essence proper to the elements; technology is that on the basis of which
the plurality of technical objects, which is the depositary of primitive technics,
serves as the basis for the constitution o f technical ensembles. Ecumenism is that
on the basis of which the universalizing unicity of religious thought, which is the
depositary of the function of primitive totality, serves as a basis for socio-political
thought. Technology accomplishes, on the basis of plurality, a conversion toward
unity, whereas ecumenism, first of all grasping unity, accomplishes or allows for the
accomplishment of a possible conversion toward a plurality of social and political
integration. The conscious grasping of this function o f plurality and of the function
of unity are necessary as a basis, so that mediation, at the level of this encounter
between the status of plurality and the status of superiority with respect to unity
that is realized by the structure of reticulation, can be possible at the neutral point
of the coming-into-being of thought.
However, in order for philosophical thought to be able to perform the integra­
tion of the sense of technics into culture, it is not enough that it applies itself to
culture outside philosophy strictly speaking, as it could accomplish a limited task

240

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

out of duty; because of the reflexivity of thought any philosophical activity is also
a reformation o f the mode of knowledge, and reverberates within the theory of
knowledge. In turn, becoming aware of the genetic aspect of technicity must lead
philosophical thought to address the problem of the relations between concept,
intuition, and idea, and correlatively, to correct the meaning of nominalism and
of realism.
It is not enough, indeed, to say that technical operation provides the paradigm
of an essentially inductive thinking, whereas religious contemplation provides the
model for a deductive theoretical thinking; this double paradigmatism is not lim­
ited to the sciences; it extends to philosophical reflection by providing it with
the modes of knowledge that can be used and transposed onto other domains.
Furthermore, the technical operation and religious contemplation provide the
implicit axiomatic for all subsequent knowledge; there is indeed a link uniting the
mode o f knowledge (by concept, intuition, or idea) to the implicit axiomatic; this
implicit axiomatic is constituted by the relation that exists between the reality to
be known and the knowing subject, i.e., by the primary status of the reality to be
known. Technical thought indeed provides the model for the intelligibility of the
elements taken one by one, in their combination, and of their mutual relations
that are constitutive of the ensemble; the real to be known resides at the end of the
effort for knowledge, it is not a mass given all at once in its totality; made of ele­
ments because it is knowable as a combination of elements, this reality is essentially
an object. Conversely, being the paradigm of deductive thought, religious thought
starts from a function o f the whole instantly recognized as having unconditional
value, and which can only be made explicit, but not constructed and produced by
the thinking subject. Religious thought provides the model for the contemplation
of being, for a respect of being that can never fully resolve itself in knowledge, but
for which a certain representation can be formed; the knowledge and the subject
who receives it remain incomplete, inferior with respect to being. It is in fact being
that is the true subject and the only complete subject. The subject of knowledge
is only a secondary subject, by reference to the first and by participation in it.
Knowledge is conceived as an imperfect doubling of being, because the subject
of knowledge is not the true subject. This contemplative mode of knowledge is
the basis for idealist realism in philosophy; the eiôoç [eidos] is a view of being, a
structure o f being that exists for itself before being thought; it is not essentially, and
from the start, an instrument o f knowledge; it is first o f all a structure of being; it is
only secondarily and by way of participation that it becomes a representation in the
soul, by virtue of a relation of kinship between the soul and the ideas; knowledge

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

241

is neither formed nor constructed by the subject; there is no genesis of knowledge,
only the discovery of the real by the mind [esprit]. Knowledge is an imitation of
being because being is essentially subject within itself, prior to any awareness by the
secondary and imperfect subject that is man; for an example o f such a metaphysical
axiomatic, one can reference the one governing the theory o f knowledge in Plato.
The Good is absolute and first subject; it is what structures the plurality of ideas,
none of which can be entirely subject for itself, insofar as it is this or that idea; the
Good is the metaphysical translation of the function of totality as subject, prior to
and higher than definite knowledge, guarantee of the intelligibility of this knowl­
edge and of its validity; all knowledge is in a certain sense knowledge o f the Good,
not in itself directly, but indirectly and by reflection [reflet], for what makes knowl­
edge be through the idea, is beings totality as one, absolute subject, toward which
all effort of particular knowledge is a movement o f ascendance. The knowledge
of man carries out in the opposite direction the ontological path going from the
Good to objects through ideas, going up from objects to the ideas o f which they are
the objects, and from the ideas to the Good, according to the analogical relation.
Operational knowledge, on the contrary, gives itself the possibility of construct­
ing its object; it dominates it and makes it appear, governing the genesis o f its
representation on the basis of m anipulate elements, in the same way the artisan
constructs the object he places before himself in order to assemble the pieces in a
coherent way. The concept, as the instrument o f operational knowledge, is itself the
result of an operation of assembly, implying the process of abstraction and general­
ization, on the basis o f an experience given in the particularity of the hic et nunc\ the
source of knowledge is here in the hic et nunc , rather than residing within uncon­
ditional totality and prior to all human gesture, governing even human gestures
that are already conditioned by it before coming into existence and being fulfilled
[accomplis]. For contemplative knowledge, the real is absolute subject, whereas for
operational knowledge it is still object, in the first sense of “that which is placed in
front,” as a piece of wood is placed on a workbench, waiting for its incorporation
into the ensemble through the process of construction. For operational knowledge,
the real does not precede the operation of knowledge; it comes after it. Even if it
appears to precede it according to common experience, it succeeds it according to
real knowledge, since this knowledge only grasps the real when it has reconstructed
it through the manipulation of elements.
Now, this opposition between the two modes of knowledge is important, for the
succession of philosophical schools shows that there are two currents of thought
that cannot be allied, and which one can generally designate by the words of

242

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

aposteriorism and apriorism; aposteriorism, which is empiricist, conceptualise and
partially nominalist (since knowledge, as it gains in abstraction, distances itself
from elementary sources) defines knowledge as the operation that uses the con­
cept; apriorism, on the contrary, being deductive, idealist, and realist unless it is
a-cosmic, defines knowledge through the grasping of the real by means of the idea.
But, if the source of this opposition and incompatibility between the two basic
metaphysical axiomatics were the split of the primitive mode of being in the
world, into technics and religion, then one would have to affirm that philosophical
knowledge cannot be content in grasping being by the concept or idea, not even
successively by one or the other mode of knowledge. Philosophical knowledge,
as the function of convergence, must call upon a mediate and higher mode of
knowledge, reuniting concepts and ideas in its unity. Now, it is not entirely correct
to identify intuition with the idea; knowledge by way of intuition is a grasping of
being that is neither a p rio ri nor a posteriori , but contemporaneous with the exis­
tence o f the being it grasps, and which is at the same level as this being; it is not
a knowledge by way of the idea, for intuition is not already contained within the
structure o f the known being; it does not belong to that being; it is not a concept,
since it has an internal unity that grants its autonomy and its singularity, prevent­
ing a genesis through accumulation; lastly, knowledge by way of intuition is really
mediate in the sense that it does not grasp being in its absolute totality, like the
idea, or on the basis o f elements and by combination, like the concept, but rather
grasps being at the level o f domains constituting a structured ensemble. Intuition
is neither sensible nor intellectual; it is the analogy between the coming-into-being
of known being and the coming-into-being of the subject, the coincidence of two
comings-into-being: intuition is not merely the grasping of figurai realities, like the
concept, nor a reference to the totality of the ground of the real taken in its unity,
like the idea; it aims at the real insofar as it forms systems in which a genesis occurs;
it is the knowledge proper to genetic processes. Bergson made intuition the mode
proper to the knowledge of coming-into-being; but one can generalize Bergsons
method, without excluding a domain like matter from intuition, because it does
not appear to present the dynamic aspects necessary for intuitive comprehension;
in fact, intuition can apply to every domain where genesis occurs, because it follows
the genesis of beings, taking each being at its level of unity, without decomposing
it into elements like conceptual knowledge, but also without destroying its iden­
tity by relativizing it with respect to the ground of a broader totality. The concept
essentially retains from its technical nature the capacity to grasp figurai realities;
conversely, the idea is particularly apt for the knowledge of ground realities.

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

243

Intuition intervenes as mediator, considering ensembles in which there is genesis of
structure, i.e., genesis of a correlation between figure and ground. Intuition is thus
a particular procedure of philosophical knowledge, because by virtue of it thought
can grasp being in its essence, which is the formula o f its genetic coming-intobeing, and remain at the neutral point o f this coming-into-being in order to ensure
the function of convergence.
For intuition, the level of unity is not totality, as with knowledge by way of idea,
nor the element, as in conceptual knowledge. In this way, philosophical thought
recovers a relation to being which was that of primitive magic, which then became
that of aesthetic activity; known being, the world, is originally neither object nor
subject; it is supposed an object when it is submitted to operational thought, as in
scientific mechanistic thought; it is supposed a subject when it inspires contem­
plative knowledge, like the Cosmos of the Stoics; but the notion of object retains
its technical origin, in the same way that the notion of subject retains its religious
origin. Neither of the two fully apply to the world or to the human being, for they
would only constitute a complete reality if they were taken together; in fact, the
notion of object and the notion of subject are, by the very virtue of their origin,
limits that philosophical thought must overcome, making knowledge according to
the object and knowledge according to the subject converge within mediate knowl­
edge, at the neutral point, according to intuition. Philosophical thought can thus
constitute itself only after having exhausted the possibilities of conceptual knowl­
edge and knowledge by idea, which is to say after gaining a technical awareness and
a religious awareness o f the real; philosophy comes after technical construction and
religious experience, and it defines itself as a capacity of intuition in the gap that
separates them. Technics and religion are thus the two guiding poles that bring out
the philosophical intuition of the real.
In philosophical thought, the relation between technics and religion is not dia­
lectical; since, precisely to the extent that technics and religion are two opposite and
complementary aspects of a primitive mode of being in the world, these two poles
must be maintained together in the couple they form; they are simultaneous. An
elucidation of philosophical problems can be valid only by accepting the unimodal
character of thought coming from a single phase. The aesthetic vision of reality
cannot satisfy philosophical research, for it only applies to chosen domains of the
real, those in which the coincidence of figurai realities and ground realities is pos­
sible without further elaboration. Aesthetic thought is not directly active; it does
not reverberate on the real from which it starts; it limits itself to exploiting the real
by detaching itself from it; it refracts aspects of reality, but it does not reflect them.

244

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Conversely, philosophical thought goes further than aesthetic activity, since in
taking genetic coming-into-being as its point o f departure, philosophical thought
reintegrates itself into genetic coming-into-being in order to fulfill it. Intuition is
effectively a relation with the real that is both theoretical and practical; it knows
and acts on it, because it grasps it in the moment in which it comes-into being;
philosophical thought is thus philosophical gesture inserting itself into the reticular
figure-ground structure that determines itself in being; philosophy intervenes as a
power of structuration, as a capacity for the invention of the structures that resolve
problems o f coming-into-being, at the level of this intermediary nature between
the plurality and totality that is the reticular diversity of the domains of existence.
Intuition recovers the figurai aspect and the ground aspect by in a real unity;
for the elements and totality are not the concrete whole [ensemble] of being; the
unity o f being is the active center on the basis of which exist, through a split, figure
and ground, i.e., the elements on the one hand and totality on the other; intuition
knows and fulfills this unity of being, which is the combination of elements and
totality; intuition is the relation o f figure and ground in itself; it is not, like the
idea, co-natural with the being it grasps, for this co-naturalness can grasp only
the ground, which is not the whole [ensemble] of being, it is not abstract like the
concept, which abandons the concreteness o f being in order to preserve only the
definite figure. Grasping the primitive relation of figure and ground, intuition is
analogical with respect to being; it is a knowledge that justifies neither full realism
nor pure nominalism, but a stable mixture of these two ways of envisioning knowl­
edge s reach; intuition is not equivalent to being, it is not being as real idea, but it is
analogical with respect to being, for intuition constitutes itself like being, through
the same coming-into-being, which is relation of figure and ground. It recovers
in being the complete existence of which magical thought was the presentiment,
before the emergence of technics and religion. One can thus say that there are
three types of intuition, according to the coming-into-being of thought; magical
intuition, aesthetic intuition, and philosophical intuition. Aesthetic intuition is
contemporary with the split of magical thought into technics and religion, it does
not perform a veritable synthesis between the two opposite phases of thinking; it
only indicates the necessity o f a relation, and accomplishes it allusively in a limited
domain. Conversely, philosophical thought must really accomplish this synthesis,
and it must construct culture as coextensive with the final result of all technical
and religious thought; aesthetic thought is thus the model of culture, but it is
not the entirety of culture; it is rather the announcement of culture, a demand
for culture, rather than culture itself; for culture must combine in a real way the

TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT

245

entirety of technical thought with the entirety of religious thought, and for this to
happen it must be made up of philosophical intuitions, whose origin lies with the
coupling carried out between concepts and ideas; aesthetic activity fills in the gap
between technics and religion, whereas philosophical thought grasps and trans­
lates the extent of this interval; it considers it as positively significant and not as a
statically free domain, but rather as a direction defined by the divergence of two
modes of thought; whereas aesthetic thought is conditioned by coming-into-being,
philosophical thought is born throughout divergent coming-into-being in order to
make it re-converge.
The technicity of technical objects can thus exist at two different levels: original
and primitive technical objects, which appeared as soon as magical thought ceased
having an important functional signification, are indeed the real depositaries of
technicity, as tools and instruments; but they are objects only to the extent that
they can be put into action by a user; the users gestures also belong to techni­
cal reality, even if they are contained in a living being that places its perceptive
power, its functions of elaboration and invention, at the service of the technical
task; the real unity is that of the task rather than that of the tool, but the task
cannot be objectivated and can only be lived, experienced, accomplished, and not
strictly speaking, reflected upon [réfléchie]. At the second level, technical objects
are part of technical ensembles. Consequently, at the first level or at the second
level, technical objects cannot be considered as absolute realities and as existing by
themselves, even after having been constructed. Their technicity can be understood
only through the integration of the activity of a human user or the functioning of a
technical ensemble. It would thus not be legitimate to seek to understand the tech­
nicity of an object on the basis of an induction comparable to that which one can
apply to natural beings; the technical object, which never harbors all of technicity
on its own, either because it is a tool or because it is the element in an ensemble,
must be known by philosophical thought, i.e., by a thought that has the intuition
of the coming-into-being of the modes of relation between man and the world.
The use of this genetic method defines the technical object through reference
to the technicity of the artisanal operation or the technical ensemble, and not the
technicity of the operation or that of the ensemble on the basis of some property
of the object that technicity would be. This functional aspect, however, and this
conditioning of the technical objects genesis are indeed effectively translated by
a particular type of the technical objects coming-into-being, what we have called
the concretization of the technical object. The process of this concretization can
be directly apprehended by the examination of a certain number of examples of

246

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

technical objects. But the sense of this concretization, which is an inherence in the
object of a technicity that is not entirely contained in it, can be understood only
by philosophical thought following the genesis of the technical and non-technical
modes o f the relation between o f man and the world. Whence the use in this study
of a genetic method applied first to technical objects and then to the study of the
situation and role o f technical thought in the whole [l'ensemble] of thought.9

CONCLUSION
To this day, the reality of the technical object has been relegated to the background
behind the reality of human work. The technical object has been apprehended
through human work, thought and judged as instrument, adjuvant, or product of
work. However, one ought to be capable, in favor o f man himself, to carry out a
reversal that would enable what is human in the technical object to appear directly,
without passing through the relation o f work. It is work that must be known as a
phase of technicity, not technicity as a phase of work, for it is technicity that is the
whole of which work forms a part, and not the reverse.
A naturalistic definition of work is insufficient; to say that work is the exploita­
tion of nature by men in society is to reduce work to an elaborate reaction by man,
taken as a species, in confrontation with nature to which he adapts and which
conditions him. What is at stake here is not a question of knowing whether this
determinism in regard to the nature-man relation is one-way or contains reciproc­
ity; the hypothesis of reciprocity does not change the basic schema, which is to say
the schema of conditioning and the reactional aspect of work. In which case it is
work that gives the technical object its meaning and not the technical object that
gives its own meaning to work.
From the perspective offered here, work can be taken as an aspect of the technical
operation, which is irreducible to work. There is work only when man must offer
his organism as tool bearer, that is, when man must, along with his organism and
his psychosomatic unity, follow the step-by-step unfolding of the human-nature
relation. Work is the activity through which man actualizes the mediation between
the human species and nature within himself; in this case we say that man operates
as tool bearer because he acts on nature in this activity and follows this action, step
by step, gesture by gesture. There is work when man cannot entrust the technical
object with the function of mediation between the species and nature, and must
fulfill this function of relation himself, through his body, his thought, his action.

248

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Man thus lends his own individuality as a living being in order to organize this
operation; it is in doing this that he is a tool bearer. On the other hand, when the
technical object is concretized, the mixture o f nature and man is constituted at the
level o f this object; operation on the technical being is not exactly work. Indeed, in
work, man coincides with a reality that is not human, submits to this reality, and
to a certain extent, slides between natural reality and human intention; in work,
man models matter according to a form; with this form, which is the intention of a
result, comes a predetermination o f what must be obtained at the end of the work
[ouvrage] in accordance with the pre-existing needs. This form-intention is not
part of the matter onto which work applies itself; it expresses a utility or necessity
for man, but it does not come from nature. The activity of work is what forms the
link between natural matter and form, which comes from man; work is an activity
that succeeds in making two realities as heterogeneous as matter and form coincide
and renders them synergetic. And the activity o f work makes man aware of the two
terms he synthetically relates, because the worker must have his eyes fixed on these
two terms which he must bring closer together (this is the norm of work), not on
the inferiority itself o f the complex operation through which this bringing together
is obtained. Work masks the relation in favor of the terms.
The servile condition o f the worker has, moreover, often contributed to making
the operation by which matter and form are made to coincide more obscure; the
man who orders [commandé] work to be done is concerned with what must appear
in the given order [ordre], in terms of content and of the raw material that is the
condition o f execution, rather than with the operation that enables the process of
taking form to occur: the attention is given to form and matter, not to the process
o f taking form as operation. The hylomorphic schema is thus a couple in which
the two terms are clear and the relation obscure. Under this particular aspect the
hylomorphic schema represents the transposition into philosophical thought of
the technical operation reduced to work, and taken as a universal paradigm of
the genesis of beings. It is indeed a technical experience, but a very incomplete
technical experience that is at the basis of this paradigm. The generalized use of the
hylomorphic schema in philosophy introduces an obscurity that comes from the
insufficiency of this schemas technical basis.
Indeed, it is not enough to enter the workshop with the worker or slave, or
even to take the mold into ones own hands and to operate the potters wheel. The
point of view o f the working man is still too external to the process of taking form,
which is the only thing that is technical in itself. It would be necessary to be able
to enter the mold with the clay, to be both mold and clay at once, to live and feel

CONCLUSION

249

their common operation in order to be able to think the process of taking form in
itself. For the worker elaborates two technical half-chains that prepare the technical
operation: he prepares the clay, makes it malleable, without lumps, without air
bubbles, and correlatively prepares the mold; he materializes the form by making it
into a wooden mold, and makes matter pliable, capable o f receiving information;
then, he puts the clay into the mold and presses it; but it is the system constituted
by the mold and the pressed clay that is the condition o f the process of taking form;
it is the clay that takes form according to the mold, not the worker who gives it its
form. The working man prepares the mediation, but he doesn’t fulfill [accomplit] it;
it is the mediation that fulfills itself on its own once the conditions have been cre­
ated; even though man is very close to this operation, he does not know it; his body
pushes the mediation to fulfill itself, enables it to fulfill itself, but the representa­
tion of the technical operation does not appear in work. It is the essential part that
is missing, the active center of the technical operation that remains veiled. For as
long as man practiced work without using technical objects, technical knowledge
could only be transmitted in an implicit and practical form, through professional
habits and gestures: this motivating [moteur] knowledge is effectively what enables
the elaboration of two technical half chains, the one starting from form and the
one starting from matter. But it does not and cannot go further, it stops before the
operation itself: it does not penetrate inside the mold. In its essence, it is pre-technical and not technical.
Technical knowledge, on the contrary, consists in starting from what happens
inside the mold in order to find the different elaborations that can prepare it by
starting from this center. Man cannot leave the center of operation in the dark,
when he no longer intervenes as tool bearer; it is the center that must effectively be
produced by the technical object, which does not think or feel, and which does not
acquire habits. In order to construct the technical object that will function, man
needs to represent to himself the way of functioning that coincides with technical
operation, which accomplishes it. The functioning of the technical object belongs
to the same order of reality, the same system of causes and effects, as the technical
operation; there is no longer heterogeneity between the preparation of the tech­
nical operation and the functioning of this operation; this operation prolongs the
technical functioning just as the functioning anticipates this operation: the func­
tioning is an operation and the operation a functioning. One cannot speak of the
work of a machine, but only of its functioning, which is an ordered ensemble of
operations. Form and matter, if they still exist, are at the same level and belong to
the same system; there is continuity between the technical and the natural.

250

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

Making the technical object is no longer accompanied by this obscure zone
between form and matter. Pre-technical knowledge is also pre-logical, in the sense
that it constitutes a couple of terms without discovering the interiority of the rela­
tion (like in the hylomorphic schema). Technical knowledge on the contrary is
logical, in the sense that it seeks the interiority of the relation.
It would be extremely important to observe that the paradigmatism arising from
the relation of work, is very different from the one coming from the technical oper­
ation, from technical knowledge. The hylomorphic schema belongs to the content
of our culture; it has been transmitted since classical Antiquity, and we often think
of this schema as perfectly grounded, not relative to a particular experience, per­
haps improperly generalized, but coextensive with universal reality. The process
of taking form ought to be treated as a particular technical operation, rather than
treating all the technical operations as particular cases of the process of taking
form, which is itself obscurely known through work.
In this sense, the study of the mode of existence of technical objects should be
extended by the study of the results of their functioning, and of mans attitudes
in the face of technical objects. A phenomenology o f the technical object would
thus be extended into a psychology o f the relation between man and the technical
object. Yet, two pitfalls should be avoided in this study, and it is precisely the
essence o f the technical operation that makes them avoidable: technical activity
belongs neither to the pure social domain nor the pure psychic domain. Technical
activity is the model o f the collective relationship, which cannot be confused with
one o f the two preceding ones; it is not the only mode and the only content of
the collective, but it is of the collective, and, in certain cases, it is around technical
activity that the collective group can arise.
What we mean here by social group is one that constitutes itself, like for ani­
mals, according to an adaptation to the conditions of the milieu; work is that
through which the human being is mediator between nature and humanity as a
species. On the opposite end, but at the same level, the inter-psychological relation
puts individual before individual, establishing a reciprocity without mediation.
Through technical activity, on the contrary, man creates mediations, and these
mediations are detachable from the individual who produces and thinks them; the
individual expresses himself in them, but does not adhere to them; the machine has
a sort o f impersonality which allows it to become an instrument for another man;
the human reality that it crystallizes within itself is alienable, precisely because it is
detachable. Work adheres to the worker, and reciprocally, through the intermedi­
ary of work, the worker adheres to the nature on which he operates. The technical

CONCLUSION

251

object, which is thought and constructed by man, is not limited to simply creating
a mediation between man and nature; it is a stable mixture o f the human and
the natural, it contains human and natural aspects; it gives its human content a
structure comparable to that of natural objects, and allows for the integration of
this human reality into the world of natural causes and effects. The relation of man
to nature, rather than being only lived and practiced obscurely, takes on a status
of stability, of consistency, making it a reality that has laws and an ordered perma­
nence. In edifying the world of technical objects and by generalizing the objective
mediation between man and nature, technical activity re-attaches man to nature
through a far richer and better defined link than that o f the specific reaction of
collective work. A convertibility of the human into the natural and of the natural
into the human establishes itself through the technical schematism.
By thus constructing a structured world, the technical operation, rather than
being pure empiricism, leads to the emergence of a new relative situation of
man and nature. Perception corresponds to the direct challenge that the natural
world puts to living man. Science corresponds to the same challenge through the
technical universe. For work without obstacles, sensation is enough; perception
corresponds to the problem that emerges at the level of work. On the other hand,
as long as technics succeed, on the contrary, scientific thought is not called upon to
emerge. When technics fail, science is near. Science corresponds to a problematic
formulated at the level of technics, but unable to find a solution at the technical
level. Technics intervenes between perception and science, in order to provoke a
change of level; it provides the schemas, the representations, and the means of
control of the mediations between man and nature. Having become detachable,
the technical object can be grouped with other technical objects according to such
or such setup [montage}', the technical world offers an indefinite availability of
groupings and connections. For what takes place is a liberation of the human real­
ity that is crystallized in the technical object; to construct a technical object is to
prepare an availability. The industrial grouping is not the only one that can be
brought about [réalisé\ with technical objects: non-productive groupings can also
be brought about, whose end is to relate man and nature through an ordered suc­
cession [enchaînement réglé] of organized mediations, to create a coupling between
human thought and nature. Here the technical world intervenes as a system of
convertibility.
The work paradigm is what pushes us to the consideration of the technical
object as a utilitarian one; the technical object does not carry its utilitarian aspect
within itself as an essential définition; it is that which performs a determinate

252

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

operation, which fulfills a certain function according to a determinate schema; but,
precisely because of its detachable aspect, the technical object can be employed in
an absolute manner as a link in a chain of causes and effects, without this object
being affected by what happens at either end; the technical object can perform the
analog o f a work task, but it can also transport information beyond any utility for
determinate production. It is the function, and not the work, that characterizes
the technical object: thus, there are not two categories of technical objects, those
serving utilitarian tasks and those serving knowledge; any technical object can be
scientific and vice-versa; to the contrary, one could call scientific a simplified object
that would only be suitable for teaching: it would be less perfect than the technical
object. The hierarchical distinction of the manual and the intellectual does not
affect the world o f technical objects.
The technical object thus carries with it a broader category than that of work:
operational functioning. This operational functioning presupposes, firstly, as a con­
dition o f possibility, an act o f invention. Now, invention is not work; it does not
presuppose the mediation between nature and the human species to be played out
by somato-psychic man. Invention is not only an adaptive and defensive reaction;
it is a mental operation, a mental functioning that is of the same order as scientific
knowledge. There is an equality of levels between science and technical invention;
the mental schema is what enables invention and science; it is the mental schema,
once more, that allows the use o f the technical object as productive, in an industrial
ensemble, or as scientific, in an experimental setup. Technical thought is present in
all technical activity, and technical thought is of the order of invention; it can be
communicated; it authorizes participation.
Henceforth, above the social community of work and beyond the inter-individ­
ual relationship not supported by an operational activity, a mental and practical
universe o f technicity establishes itself, in which human beings communicate
through what they invent. The technical object taken according to its essence,
which is to say the technical object insofar as it has been invented, thought and
willed, and taken up \assume\ by a human subject, becomes the medium [le support]
and symbol of this relationship, which we would like to name transindividual. The
technical object can be read as carrier of a definite information; if it is only used,
employed,10 and consequently enslaved, then it cannot bring any information, any
more than a book that would be used as a wedge or pedestal. The technical object
that is appreciated and known according to its essence, i.e., according to the human
act that has founded it, penetrated it with functional intelligibility, valorized it
10. In French, the primary meaning of employer, before its secondary one o f “to employ in the sense o f to hire for work, is
“to use.” [TN]

CONCLUSION

253

according to its internal norms, carries with it pure information. One can call pure
information an information that is not evental, one that can be understood only if
the subject receiving it solicits within itself a form analogous to the forms carried
by the medium [le support ] of information; what is known in the technical object
is the form, the material crystallization o f an operational schema and of a thought
that has resolved a problem. In order for this form to be understood it is necessary
that there be analogous forms in the subject: information is not an absolute advent,
but the signification resulting from a relation of forms, one extrinsic and the other
intrinsic with respect to the subject. Hence, in order for the object to be received as
technical and not only as useful, in order for it to be judged as the result of inven­
tion, as a carrier of information, and not as utensil, the subject receiving it must
have technical forms within himself. An inter-human relation that is the model of
transindividuality is thus created through the intermediary of the technical object.
This can be understood as a relationship that does not relate individuals by means
of their constituted individuality separating them from one another, nor by means
of what is identical in every human subject, for instance the a p rio ri forms of sensi­
bility, but by means of this weight [charge] of pre-individual reality, this weight of
nature that is preserved with the individual being, and which contains potentials
and virtualities. The object that emerges from technical invention carries with it
something of the being that has produced it, and from this being expresses what is
least attached to the hic et nunc, one could say that there is something of human
nature in the technical being, in the sense that this word “nature” could be used to
designate the remainder of what is original, prior even to the humanity constituted
in man; man invents by putting to work his own natural material [support], this
arceipov [âpeiron] which remains attached to each individual being. No anthropology taking as its starting point man as individual being can account for the
transindividual technical relationship. Work, conceived as productive, insofar as it
comes from the localized individual hic et nunc , cannot account for the invented
technical being; it is not the individual who invents, it is the subject, vaster than
the individual, richer than it, and having, in addition to the individuality of the
individuated being, a certain weight of nature, of non-individuated being. The
social group of functional solidarity, like the community of work, puts only indi­
viduated beings into relation. For this reason, it necessarily localizes and alienates
them, even beyond all economic modality such as the one Marx describes under the
name of capitalism: one could define a pre-capitalist alienation essential to work
as work. Moreover, and symmetrically, the inter-individual psychological relation
cannot put anything other than constituted individuals into relation; rather than

254

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

putting them into relation by means o f their somatic functioning, as work does,
it puts them into relation at the level of certain ways of conscious, affective, rep­
resentative functioning, and alienates them just as much. The alienation of work
cannot be compensated by way o f another alienation, which would be that of the
psychical detachment [psychique détaché\\ which is what explains the weakness of
the psychological methods applied to the problem of work and which want to
resolve the problems by means o f mental functions. The problems of work are the
problems having to do with the alienation caused by work, and this alienation is
not only economic, through the play of surplus value; neither Marxism, nor this
counter-Marxism, that is the psychologism in the study of work through human
relations, can find the true solution, because they place both sources of alienation
outside of work, whereas work itself insofar as it is work is the source of alienation.
We don’t mean to say that economic alienation doesn’t exist; but it is possible that
the primary cause o f alienation resides essentially within work, and that the alien­
ation described by Marx is only one o f the modalities o f this alienation: the notion
o f alienation is worth generalizing in order that one might situate the economic
aspect o f alienation; according to this doctrine, economic alienation would already
exist at the level of the superstructures, and would presuppose a more implicit
foundation, which is the alienation that is essential to the situation of the individ­
ual at work.
If this hypothesis is right, then the true path toward the reduction of alienation
would not be situated within the domain of the social (with the community of
work and class), nor in the domain of inter-individual relationships that social
psychology habitually envisages, but at the level of the transindividual collective.
338 The technical object made its appearance in a world in which social structures
and psychic contents were formed by work: the technical object thus entered into
the world o f work, instead o f creating a technical world with new structures. The
machine is thus known and used through work and not through technical knowl­
edge; the relation of the worker to the machine is inadequate, because the worker
operates on the machine without his gesture continuing the activity of invention
in this gesture. The obscure central zone characteristic of work has transferred itself
to the utilization of the machine: it is now the functioning of the machine, the
provenance o f the machine, the signification of what the machine does and the
way in which it is made that is the obscure zone. The primitive central obscurity of
the hylomorphic schema is preserved: man knows what goes into the machine and
what comes out, but not what happens in it: an operation takes place in the very
presence of the worker in which he does not participate, not even if he commands

CONCLUSION

255

or serves it. To command is still to remain external to what one commands, when
commanding consists in the activation according to a pre-established setup, made
for this activation, planned in order to operate this activation within the schema
of the technical object s construction. The worker s alienation is translated by the
break between technical knowledge and the exercise of the conditions of use. This
break is so noticeable that the function of adjusting the machine is strictly distinct
from that of the machine s user in a large number of factories, in other words, dis­
tinct from the worker, and it is prohibited for workers to adjust [régler] their own
machines by themselves. The activity of adjustment, however, is the one that most
naturally continues the function of invention and construction: adjustment is a
perpetual, if limited, invention. The machine is not, indeed, thrown into existence
once and for all from the moment o f its construction, without the necessity of
touch-ups, repairs, or adjustments. The original technical schema of invention is
more or less properly realized within each produced unit [exemplaire ], which is why
each unit more or less functions properly. It is by reference not to the materiality
and particularity of each unit of a technical object, but by reference to the technical
schema of invention that adjustments and reparations are possible and effective;
what man receives is not the direct product of technical thought, but a unit of
fabrication carried out on the basis of technical thought with more or less precision
and perfection; this unit of fabrication is the symbol of technical thought, a carrier
of forms that must encounter a subject in order to carry on and complete this
accomplishment of technical thought. The user must have forms within himself
so that, from the encounter of these technical forms with the forms carried by the
machine, and more or less perfectly realized in it, a signification emerges on the
basis of which the work done on a technical object becomes a technical activity and
not simply work. The technical activity distinguishes itself from mere work, and
from alienating work, in that technical activity comprises not only the use of the
machine, but also a certain coefficient of attention to the technical functioning,
maintenance, adjustment, and improvement of the machine, which continues the
activity of invention and construction. The fundamental alienation resides in the
break occuring between the ontogenesis of the technical object and the existence of
this technical object. The genesis of the technical object must effectively be a part
of its existence, and the relation of man to the technical object must contain this
attention to the continued genesis of the technical object.
The technical objects that produce the greatest alienation are those meant for
ignorant users. Such objects progressively deteriorate: they are new for a short time,
and quickly begin to devalue when losing this aspect of being new because they

256

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

can only distance themselves from the conditions of initial perfection. The sealing
of delicate organs is indicative of this divide between the manufacturer, who is
identified with the inventor, and the user who only acquires usage of the technical
object through an economic process; the warranty concretizes the purely economic
aspect o f this relation between manufacturer and user; in no way does the user
continue the act of the manufacturer; through the warranty, the user purchases
the right to force the manufacturer to return to the activity of manufacturing once
again should the need become apparent. On the contrary, technical objects, that
are not subject to such a status of separation between construction and use do not
deteriorate over time; they are conceived so that the different organs constituting
them can be continually replaced and repaired over the course of use: maintenance
is not separate from construction, it continues it, and in certain cases, completes
it, for instance by means o f breaking it in [rodage], which is the prolongation and
completion of construction through rectification of the surface conditions during
their functioning. When the breaking-in cannot be performed by the user because
o f the limitations it imposes, then it must be done by the manufacturer after the
assembly of the technical object, as is the case with plane engines.
The alienation resulting from the artificial divide between construction and use
is thus perceptible not only by the man who uses the machine, or works on it, and
cannot push his relationship with it beyond work; it also has repercussions within
the economic and cultural conditions of the use of the machine and into the eco­
nomic value of the machine in the form of a devaluation of the technical object,
which happens more quickly the more accentuated this rupture is.
Economic concepts are insufficient to account for the alienation that is charac­
teristic of work. It is in and of themselves that the attitudes of work are inadequate
to technical thought and technical activity, because what is lacking therein are the
forms and the explicit mode of knowledge that are close to the sciences, and that
would enable knowledge o f the technical object. In order to reduce alienation, one
would have to bring the aspect of work, of effort, of concrete application implying
the use of the body, and of the interaction of function back to the unity of techni­
cal activity. It is, however, correct to say that the economic conditions amplify and
stabilize this alienation: the technical object does not belong to the men who use it
in industrial life. Furthermore, the relationship o f property is very abstract, and it
wouldn’t be enough for workers simply to be the owners of their machines in order
for alienation to be abruptly reduced; to possess a machine is not to know it. Non­
possession, however, increases the distance between the worker and the machine
on which his work is accomplished; it makes the relation even more fragile, more

CONCLUSION

257

external, more precarious. It would have to be possible to discover a social and
economic mode whereby the user o f the technical object would not only be the
owner of this machine, but also the man who chooses it and who maintains it.
The worker, however, is placed in the presence of the machine without having
chosen it; being placed in the presence of a machine is part of the conditions of
employment, it is integrated into the socio-economic aspect o f production. In an
inverse sense, the machine is most often fabricated as an absolute technical object,
functioning in itself, but poorly adapted to the exchange of information between
the machine and man. Human engineering11 does not go far enough in seeking
to discover the best arrangement of command organs and control signals; this is
indeed extremely useful research, and it is the point of departure for the search for
the true conditions of the coupling between man and machine. But this research
runs the risk of not being very effective unless it goes as far as the very foundation
of the communication between man and machine. In order for information to
be exchanged, man must possess within himself a technical culture, which is to
say an ensemble of forms that, upon encountering the forms contributed by the
machine, will be able to elicit meaning [signification]. The machine remains one
of the obscure zones of our civilization, at all social levels. This alienation exists as
much at the management level [dans la maîtrise] as it does at the level of workers.
The true center of industrial life, that in relation to which everything must order
itself in accordance with functional norms, is technical activity. To ask oneself who
owns the machine, who has the right to use [employer] new machines and who has
the right to refuse them, is to turn the problem upside-down; the categories of
capital and labor are inessential with respect to technical activity. The foundation
of the norms and of law in the industrial domain is neither labor nor property,
but technicity. Inter-human communication must establish itself at the level of
technics through technical activity, not via the values of work or economic criteria;
social conditions and economic factors cannot be harmonized because they are
parts of different ensembles; they can only find mediation within a predominantly
technical organization. This level of technical organization where man encounters
man not as the member of a class but as a being who expresses himself within the
technical object which is homogeneous with respect to his activity, is the level of
the collective, going beyond the inter-individual and the given social.
The relation with the technical object cannot become adequate individual by
individual, except in very rare and isolated cases; it can establish itself only to
the extent that it will succeed in making this inter-individual collective reality,1

258

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

which we name transindividual, exist, because it creates a coupling between the
inventive and organizational capacities of several subjects. There is a relation of
causality and reciprocal conditioning between the existence of clear, non alienated
technical objects used according to a status which does not alienate, and the con­
stitution o f such a transindividual relationship. It might be desirable for industrial
life and companies to have technical committees at the level of their employee
councils; in order to be efficient and creative, an employee committee should be
essentially technical. The organization of channels of information in a company
must follow the lines of technical operation and not that of social hierarchy or of
purely inter-individual relations, which are inessential with respect to technical
operation. The company, being the ensemble of technical objects and men, must
be organized on the basis o f its essential function, that is its technical function­
ing; it is at the level o f the technical operation that the whole [ensemble] of the
organization can be thought, not as a confrontation of classes, i.e., as a pure social
ensemble, or as a grouping of individuals each having their psyche, which brings
the ensemble down to an inter-psychological schema, but as a unit [une unité\ of
technical functioning. The technical world is a world of the collective, which is
adequately thought neither on the basis of the brute social [fact], nor on the basis
of the psyche. To consider technical activity as inessential in its very structure,
and to take as essential either the social communities or the inter-human relations
arising from technical activity, means not analyzing the nature of this very center
o f group and of inter-individual relationships, which is technical activity. To keep
the notion o f work as the center of the social, and the antagonistic permanence
o f a psychologism of human relations at the level of management and of capital,
shows that technical activity is not thought for itself: it is approached only through
sociological or economic concepts, studied as an occasion of inter-psychological
relationships, but not grasped at the level of its real essence: the obscure zone sub­
sists between capital and work, between psychologism and sociologism; developing
between the individual and the social is the transindividual, which is, currently, not
recognized and is studied through the two extreme aspects of either the work of the
laborer or the management of the company.
The criterion of productivity [rendement], as well as the will to characterize tech­
nical activity through productivity cannot lead to a resolution of the problem;
productivity is very abstract with respect to technical activity and does not allow
one to enter into this activity in order to see its essence; several very different tech­
nical schemas can lead to identical levels of productivity; a number does not express
a schema; the study of productivities and the means to improve them allows the

CONCLUSION

259

obscurity of the technical zone to persist as completely as the hylomorphic schema
does; it can only contribute to confusing the theoretical problems, even though it
plays a practical role in the current structures.
But, philosophical thought can play a role in this elucidation of technical reality
as an intermediary between the social and the individual psyche in the order of
deontological problems. One cannot account for technical activity by classifying it
among the practical needs of man, which is to say by allowing it to appear as a cat­
egory of work. Bergson attached the technical activity to homo fa b e r , and showed
its relation with intelligence. But in this idea of the manipulation of solids as the
foundation of technicity there is a presupposition that prevents the discovery of
genuine technicity. Bergson in fact starts from the axiological dualism of the closed
and the open, of the static and the dynamic, o f work and reverie; work attaches
man to the manipulation o f solids, and the necessities of action are at the source
[au principe ] of an abstracting conceptualization, of the primacy given to the static
with respect to the dynamic, to space with respect to time. The activity of work
is thus enclosed well within materiality and attached to the body. This is so true
that science itself, whose use of technical schemas Bergson sensed, is considered as
having a practical and pragmatic function. In this sense, Bergson would be fairly
close to the broad trend of scientific nominalism, mixed with a certain pragmatism,
which one can sense in Poincaré, and then in Le Roy, inspired by both Bergson and
Poincaré. However, one might wonder whether this pragmatic and nominalist atti­
tude toward the sciences is not based on an inexact analysis of technicity. In order
to be able to affirm that the sciences have their sights set on the real, that they want
the thing, it is not necessary to show that they have no relation with technics; for it
is work that is pragmatic, not technical activity; the gesture of work is directed by
its immediate utility. But technical activity reaches the real only at the end of a long
process of elaboration; it rests on laws, it is not improvised; for technical solutions
to be efficient, they must reach the real according to the laws of the real itself; in
this sense, technics are objective despite all the aspects of utility they may present.
Pragmatism is not wrong only because it incorrectly reduces the sciences to tech­
nics, whereas scientific knowledge emerges when technics fail before the real or
fail to harmonize among themselves. Pragmatism is also wrong because it believes
that it reduces science to a purely improvised solution by reducing it to technical
activity. At root, pragmatism conflates work and technical operation.
In this sense the analysis of the mode of existence of technical objects therefore
has an epistemological import. A doctrine like Bergsons opposes work to leisure
and gives leisure, in the form of reverie, a fundamental epistemological privilege:

260

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

this opposition returns to the one made by the Ancients between servile occupa­
tions and the liberal, disinterested occupations, having the value of pure knowledge,
whereas servile occupations only had a value of utility. Pragmatism, by appearing
to reverse the hierarchy of values, defines the true by the useful; but it preserves the
schema of opposition between the norm of utility and the norm of truth, to such
an extent that it results in a relativism in the order of knowledge, or at nominalism
if this attitude is pushed to its most rigorous and extreme consequences; science is
not more true, but more useful for action than common perception.
If, on the contrary, one appeals to the veritable mediation between nature and
man, namely to technics and to the world of technical objects, then one arrives at
a theory o f knowledge that is no longer nominalist. It is through operation that a
becoming aware takes place, but operational is not synonymous with practical ; the
technical operation is not arbitrary, pliable in every way to the whims of the sub­
ject according to the randomness o f immediate utility; the technical operation is a
pure operation that puts into play the veritable laws of natural reality; the artificial
is something natural that has been solicited, not something false or human that
has been mistaken for something natural. In Antiquity, the opposition between
operational knowledge and contemplative knowledge valorized contemplation,
and the o^oXri [skhole] that conditioned it. Technics, however, is neither work nor
ayo^f| [skholé]. Philosophical thought, insofar as it comes from the tradition and
uses schemas coming from the tradition, does not contain any reference to this
intermediary reality between work and ayoÀxi [skhole]. Axiological thought itself
is at two levels and reflects this opposition between work and contemplation; the
notions of the theoretical and the p ractic al still refer to this adversative distinction.
In this sense, it is permissible to think that the dualism inherent in philosophical
thought, a dualism o f principles and attitudes because of the double reference to
the theoretical and the practical, will be profoundly modified by the introduc­
tion of technical activity considered as an area of reflection within philosophical
thought. Bergson has only reversed the correspondences of G%oX,f| [skhole] and
work, by granting work the function o f establishing a relationship with solids,
hence with what is static, whereas the Ancients considered it a fall into the world
of generation and corruption, hence of coming-into-being; Bergson, inversely,
attributes to g^oAti [skhole] the power to allow a coincidence with duration, with
the moving, whereas the Ancients assigned to contemplation the role of enabling
knowledge of the eternal. But this reversal does not change the condition of duality
and the devaluation of the term corresponding to the work of man, whether this
term is the moving or the static. It seems that this opposition between action and

contemplation, between the immutable and the moving, must cease in the face of
the introduction of the technical operation within philosophical thought as area of
reflection and even as paradigm.

Rocker switches. Component part with two states of equilibrium. When the two
states o f equilibrium are stable, the rocker is called indifferent; if it has both a stable
state o f equilibrium and an unstable state of equilibrium, it is called monostable: it
goes from the stable state to the unstable or almost stable under the influence of an
external signal; if the monostable rocker spontaneously returns to the stable state
as soon as the signal disappears, then it is only called a monostable switch; if on the
contrary, after the disappearance of the signal, the quasi-stable state continues for
a time whose duration is determined by the characteristics of the circuit, then the
setup is called a differentiated monostable rocker.
The Eccles-Jordan circuit constitutes an indifferent rocker; two identical triodes
are coupled such that one is blocked (non-conductive as a result of a strong nega­
tive polarization of its command grid) while the other is conductive: a fraction of
the anodic potential of each triode is transmitted to the other triode s grid through
a resistance. The external signals arrive indistinctly on both anodes and are trans­
mitted to the grids by the bridge dividing the resistances and by the condensers.
These signals, in the form of negative pulses, do not act on the blocked triode, but
modify the state of the conducting triode, which leads to the switching of the setup:
the previously conductive triode becomes non-conductive, and the non-conduc­
tive triode becomes conductive. This circuit is often used in calculating machines,
because it delivers only one o f the two pulses it receives, this pulse in turn is capable
of activating another ensemble of triodes; it therefore realizes through its physical
functioning the analog of the mental operation of addition. To establish a chain
of Eccles-Jordan circuits, a counting scale using a numeric system on the basis
of 2 has to be built. In its pure form, the counting scale is used at the output of
pulse counters, and more specifically in the measurement of radioactivity; when
integrated into more complex setups, it provides the basis for binary electronic
calculating machines. It is possible to construct mechanical rockers: however, the

264

electronic rocker presents a considerable advantage, which is that of functioning
speed (100,000 state changes per second).

Amplification class. Amplification classes are defined by the classes of functioning
o f the electronic tubes, which perform this function; the class corresponds to the
position o f the point o f functioning on the characteristic of the anodic current in
relation to the command grid s voltage; in class A, the point of functioning moves
without leaving the rectilinear part o f the characteristic; in class B, the grid receives
a negative polarization such that the anodic current remains null in the absence
of variable voltage on the grid; in class C, the grid receives an even stronger polar­
ization. Under these conditions, in class A, an average signal does not noticeably
change the average anodic throughput; but, if the signal increases, with a light bulb
mounted in automatic polarization through the insertion of a resistor in the cath­
ode, then the resulting increase in polarization diminishes the lamps slope, which
constitutes a negative reaction.

Electrolytic condenser. A condenser constituted by two electrodes immersed in
an electrolytic liquid which, electrolyzed by the flow of a current, deposits a thin
layer of insulation onto one of the electrodes; the liquid thus constitutes one of the
plates, separated from the electrode covered by the insulating layer that plays the
role o f a dielectric. Left to its own devices, the condenser loses its dielectric, but
the latter reforms after the current has flowed for a given period of time. This type
of condenser enables the collecting of a rather large quantity of energy in a rather
small volume, due to the thinness o f the insulating layer; it has a maximum voltage
of utilization (550 to 600 volts) and is characterized by more important losses than
those of a condenser with a dry and permanent dielectric, such as mica or paper).

Converter. An ensemble constituted by an electric motor and a mechanically
coupled generator. In contrast with the converter, the commutator uses a single
rotor, which creates, in addition to the mechanical coupling, a magnetic coupling
between the two coils, preventing the conversion of alternating current into con­
tinuous current, whereas the converter, despite a lower output, can perform this
conversion.

Detonation and deflagration. Detonation is a combustion that, at the heart of an
explosive mixture, occurs in an extremely brief time and at all points of the volume
at the same instant. Deflagration on the other hand is a rapid but progressive

GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL WORDS

265

combustion, starting in one point and propagating step by step across the entire
volume, in the form of an explosive wave, like the burning of a trail o f [explosive]
powder that one ignites at one end.
Detonation is generally conditioned by a global state of the system (temperature,
pressure) acting on all the gas molecules at the same instant, whereas deflagration
must be triggered at a single point. Detonation exerts a destructive rupture effect;
it is this that one seeks to obtain in dynamite through a percussion that creates a
state of pressure on the entire mass of the charge at the same instant (the trigger has
a mercury fulminate, whose purpose is not to ignite, but to compress); an explo­
sive charge, lit at a single point, deflagrates rather than detonating. In an engine,
combustion must be triggered before the global state of temperature and pressure
provokes a detonation, causing the phenomenon called clatter.

Magneto. Complex electric machine, composed of one or several fixed magnets,
which create a magnetic field where two coils are wound up together around a
steel core rotate. The first coil is made of thick wire (like the primary coil of an
induction coil), is short circuited through an external switch by the axis of the
steel core; this switch opens the moment the variation o f flux through the core is
at its maximum, i.e., the moment where the current is most intense in the primary
winding. The abrupt variation in intensity caused by this break in the primary
winding creates a peak of elevated voltage in the secondary coil made of thick long
wire, playing the role of the secondary coil of an induction coil. This high voltage
pulse, distributed by a turning distributor on either spark igniter, creates a spark
between the electrodes of the light bulb.
The magneto thus produces both low voltage energy and the high intensity of the
primary, like a magnetic alternator, and high voltage pulse, like a Ruhmkorff coil
(pulse transformer); lastly, it is the revolving of the axis that commands the rupture
causing the variation of voltage in the primary circuit; it is this revolving that once
more activates the distributor, alternately sending the peak of high voltage unto
the spark igniters during the course of the igniting circuit. In addition to its con­
crete aspect, the magneto presents the following advantage: the higher the speed of
rotation, the greater the variation in magnetic flux in the core will be, giving rise to
a homeostatic effect: ignition is more energetic at high rather than low operating
levels, which compensates for the greater difficulty of a correct ignition at higher
operating levels following the mixing of the carburized mix in the cylinder; on the
contrary, when lit by a battery and an induction coil, the energy available for the
primary coil decreases as the engine speed increases, because of the phenomena of

266

ON THE MODE OF EXISTENCE OF TECHNICAL OBJECTS

self-induction o f the primary coil, opposing themselves to the sufficiently rapid
establishing of curing in the primary. However, because of the plurifunctional role
o f its components, the magneto requires a high quality manufacturer.

Magnetostriction. Variations in the volume o f a piece of metal under the influence
o f a magnetic field; iron and nickel present important properties of magneto­
striction. If the magnetic field is alternating, a mechanical vibration results. This
phenomenon is used to construct an electromechanical converter suited to high fre­
quencies (ultrasound generators); it interferes with the transformers in oscillators,
because the vibrations produced by the magnetic circuits plates are transmitted
into the framework and create a sound that is difficult to suppress.
Curie temperature. Temperature above which magnetization is unstable: ferromag­
netic substances abruptly become paramagnetic; for iron, the Curie temperature is
approximately 775° C.

Relaxant. Setup o f natural ensemble that is the seat of a phenomenon of relaxation.
The phenomenon o f relaxation is a non-oscillating iterative functioning (repeating
itself for an indefinite number o f times and in a regular way); in relaxation, at the
end o f a cycle, i.e., the state o f the system at the end of the cycle, it triggers the
beginning of the cycle by starting a defined phenomenon: thus there is disconti­
nuity from one cycle to the next; when a cycle is started, it continues on its own,
but each cycle, in order to produce itself, requires the completion o f the preceding
one. Such is the functioning o f intermittent fountains: the siphon begins, which
entails the flowing of a certain quantity of liquid; then the siphon stops and will
not recommence until the level of water has reached a certain height. A hydrau­
lic ram functions by relaxation. On the contrary, in oscillation this critical phase
of recommencement of the cycle is absent, but a continuous transformation of
energy, for instance of potential energy into kinetic energy in the heavy pendulum,
or of electrostatic energy into electro-dynamic energy, in an oscillating circuit with
self-inductance and capacity. Oscillators operate in a sinusoidal manner, whereas
relaxers do so in a “saw tooth” pattern. In fact, only oscillators have a real oscilla­
tion period; relaxants have a period only in relation to well defined magnitudes,
for instance the amount of energy expended in each cycle; any variation in these
magnitudes entails a variation of the duration of the cycle; whereas oscillators have
a period defined by the characteristics of the setup itself. The confusion between an
oscillator and a relaxant comes from the need to plan for the systems maintenance

GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL WORDS

267

of the oscillations which call upon devices functioning as relaxants; hence, if one
inserts a triode into a circuit with self-inductance and the capacity to maintain the
oscillations, one can no longer obtain rigorously sinusoidal oscillations; one must
then choose between obtaining a low level of almost sinusoidal oscillations and the
production o f a high level o f oscillations distancing itself notably from the sinusoid,
which require a strong coupling between the oscillating system and the maintenance
system; at the same time as this coupling increases, the behavior moves toward that
of a relaxant, with greater dependency o f the frequency on external conditions
(in particular the amount of energy dissipated during each cycle). The relaxation
oscillator, which does not have an issue such as kinetic energy (inertia) is very easy
to adjust; thus, a thyratron mounted in a system with resistances and capacitors can
be adjusted by a variation of voltage on the control gate, determining the critical
point of recommencement of the cycle. A genuine oscillator, on the other hand,
is less easily adjustable and synchronizable: it is more autonomous, as one can see
from pilot-oscillators, possessing a weak coupling of the maintenance circuit with
the oscillating circuit, and a low level of output. Bodies that are both elastic and
piezo-electric, like quartz, provide excellent oscillating circuits; a vibrating blade, a
diapason can also provide oscillating systems that can be self-maintained.

Thermo-siphon. A device transporting heat, for heating or cooling, using the fact
that water dilates, and consequently becomes lighter as it heats up; water becomes
lighter and rises within the hot half of the circuit, while it becomes denser and
descends and returns into the hot source. The circulation is all the more rapid as
the difference in temperature between the hot source and cold source becomes
larger: this system is thus homeostatic. However, because of the slowness of the
circulation of water, it requires a more cumbersome and heavier apparatus than
that used by a pump.

Synchronization pip. Brief signals enabling the enslaving of a device with recur­
rent functioning to a pilot device. When the pilot device is a sinusoidal oscillator,
a brief signal, whose phase is well determined (for instance by capping the voltage
of oscillation), is extracted prior to this oscillation. French television broadcasting
standards place synchronization signals in the infra-black, below the voltage at
which the electromagnetic beam of the cathodic ray tube becomes extinct, such
that they can be transmitted on the same frequency as that which carries the mod­
ulation of the image without disturbing the latter: the passage from one line to the
next, or from one image to the next, is translated only by a complete extinction of
the dot on the screen.
