> We are interested in exploring this intersection as a form of convergence, in the sense of mutually enabling discourses about and embedded in technologies. Specifically, we explore how deterministic thinking is embedded within genetic science, and the selling of genetic testing products to consumers online. We refer to these as ‘intersecting determinisms’, with implications not only for governance but for the ways in which we study such new products and phenomena (see also Appendix A). Our assumption is that determinisms of genetics are converging with determinisms of the internet, and from this convergence, genetic testing products have been developed, with internet-enabled reach directly to potential consumers and research participants far beyond the clinic. 15 {#platform-discourse}


>In this book, we focus on different types of internet-based platforms. The most prominent are the websites of companies selling direct-to-consumer genetic tests. Such sites are no longer the ‘flat’ sites, common in the mid-1990s, which were often little more than online brochures and leaflets. Many of the DTC genetic test- ing companies use a variety of web 2.0 platforms in order to engage and interact with consumers, including blogs, Twitter and YouTube. User-generated content such as feedback on forums and blog comments feed into company research design. Users’ web activity is also collected through log files and cookies, so that web behaviour data are used by the companies in order to monitor use of their website, to improve their services and to tailor and customise content for customers. Data are also exchanged when people purchase genetic tests, as we describe more fully in the section below about trust in both online spaces and in genetics. 13


> Autobiologies differ from illness narratives in that they are not stories about states of sickness and suffering, but are rather narratives of playfulness, possible to those ‘in-waiting’ who can afford a more casual engagement with the technologies. It may be that the media by which these stories are told, YouTube video for example, invites a more casual performance, an indif- ference towards illness that may differ from other forms of storytelling, highlighting the importance of context in analysis of these narratives. We have highlighted the advantage of using the term ‘autobiology’ to consider these narratives about emerging states of illness ambiguity.50 

> Autobiologies draw from and contribute to the world of DTC genetic testing – they become part of the online texts about genetic testing, and the companies themselves are increasingly playing with this format with video competitions and other YouTube related activ- ities, no doubt aware of the conversations their customers are having on this platform. 50
>Autobiologies occur widely across the cultural landscapes of (at least) highly industrialised societies, with an increasing presence of devices allowing us to monitor our biological selves (e.g. blood sugar, heart rate, blood pressure) and to weave these ‘data’ into our personal narratives. 51


>The possibilities of autobiology continue to expand with the creativity of platform producers. 51
