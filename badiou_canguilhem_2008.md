Badiou, Alain. 1998. “Is there a theory of the subject in Georges Canguilhem?.” Economy and Society 27(2): 225 - 233.

For its part, the human subject is entailed in both terms of the conflict. As the subject of science, through mathematics, experiment and technique, it constitutes the absolute real universe from which every centre is absent. As a living subject, through the changeable singularity of its centred, normed and meaningful natural milieu, it objects to this universe. Henceforth, the notion of a 'subject' somehow designates not just one of the terms of the clash of absolutes, but rather the enigma of this discordance itself. 227

In this the subject of biological knowledge is reducible neither to the living being nor to the scientist. This means also, and here I evoke the second great discontinuity where the word subject is called upon in some way, that this subject is neither technical nor scientific 228-9

in the knowledge of life, the a prioris do not exist on the side of the subject but on that of the object or the thing. 230
If it is neither psychological, nor transcendental, nor substantial, what then can this subject, the entire visible effect of which is subtractive or a resistance to objectification, be positively?231

But he also gathers information by moving around (se diplacer), and by moving objects around, with the aid of various kinds of technology . . . moving things around and changing the relations among objects. Knowledge, then, is an anxious quest for the greatest possible quantity and variety of information. If the a priori is in things, if the concept is in life, then to be a subject of knowledge is simply to be dissatisfied with the meaning one finds ready at hand. Subjectivity is therefore nothing other than dissatisfaction. Perhaps that is what life is. Interpreted in a certain way, contemporary biology is, somehow, a philosophy of life. (Canguilhem 1994: 3 19) 232

there is a subject for Canguilhem only insofar as we can say that in the universe there exists a living being that, dissatisfied with meaning and fitted for moving the configurations of its objectivity, always appears, in the order of life and in the ambiguity of the adjective, as a somewhat displaced (diplace? living being. 233
