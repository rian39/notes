in order to capitalize on something, it must be either considered as an _asset_, or turned into one. 12 

Capital, we posit, is not a thing in itself --- something that one has or has not -- but rather a form of action, a method of control, an act of configuration, an _operation_. 14

Capitalization is an event, an empirical moment, an occurrence, an action, and should be approached as such 17

Attention must be paid to the scope and range of an operation that typically connects distant situations and configures large social realities. 17

Studying capitalization is also redefining it, engaging with it, against it, alongside it. 127 

Becoming an _object of investment_ is the crucial entry point here. This can happen to anything 128

Something that becomes an object of investment does something more: it becomes an asset. What makes something an asset? First, it must be neatly delineated. ... Second, it must have economic value. 129

Capitalization, considered as a transitive process of valuation, requires some sort of a focal point -- a gaze -- from which to make sense of the answer to the "for whom" question. 131

The scenario is the narrative configuration in which the gazes makes sense. 131
