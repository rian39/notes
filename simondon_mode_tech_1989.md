## Introduction

raise the degree of technicity: increase the margin which permits the machine to be sensible to exterior information 11 {#platform-positive} {#device}

machine of high technicity is open, and supposes human as permanent organiser and interpreter of machines in relation to each other. 11 {#ensemble} {#device}

He is _among_ the machine which operate with him 12

Through intermediary of margin of indetermination and not through automatism that the machines can be grouped in coherent ensembles,  12 {#ensemble} {#automate}

Habitual usage is not a good guide because it ... 13

3 levels of technical object: technical element, technical individual, and technical ensemble 15 {#ensemble} {#platform-definition}

technicity tends to reside at the level of the ensemble today -- supplies unity and stability 16 {#ensemble} {#technicity}

## pt 1 

### ch 1

negative relation between personalisation and technical object 24

technical object, issue from abstract work of organisation of sub-ensembles, is theatre of certain number of relations of reciprocal causality. 27 

difference between technical object and object of science;  technical object is never fully concrete or known 35-36

progress in technical object is discovery of functional synergies 37

technical object as that of which there is genesis does not occur continuously but by oriented mutations 40 

technical object has a posterity because it is not saturated  43

concretisation means that technical object is between natural object and scientific representation 46 {#earth} {#objectivity} {#device}

### ch  2 -- evolution of technical reality: element, individual and ensemble

technical object is at the meeting point of two miliue, and must integrate two milieu at once. 52

L'objet technique est au point de rencontre de deux milieux, et il doit tre intgr aux deux milieux  fois. 52 - they are not necessarily compatible ...

the two worlds act on each other through the technical object 53


Le adaptation-concrtisation est un processus qui conditionnne la naissance d'un milieu au lieu dtre conditionn par un milieu dj donn; il est  conditionne par un milieu qui n'existe que virtuellement avant l段nvention; il y a invention parce qu段l y a un saut qui s弾ffectue et se justifie par la relation qu段l institue ?l段nt?ieur du milieu qu段l cr?. 55

On pourrait dire que l’invention concétisante réalise un milieu techno-géographique (...), qui est une condition de possibilité du fonctionnement de l’objet technique 55

One could say that concretising invention realises a techno-geographic milieu .. which is a condition of possibility of the functioning of the technical object 55

the technical object is thus the condition of itself as condition of existence of this mixed milieu, technical and geographical at once 55

evolution of technical object can only progress to the extent they are free from fatal hypertelos 56

For that, they need to create a third milieu, a technogeographical milieu on which each modification is auto-conditioned. 56

the only things that are really invented as the ones that need an associated milieu to be viable 57

associated milieu: recurrence of causalite in a milieu that the technical being creates around itself and which conditions it as it is conditioned by it. 57 {#ensemble} {#making}

C'est parce que le vivant est un être individuel qui porte avec lui son milieu associé que le vivant peut inventer; cette capacité de se conditionner soi-même est au principe de la capacité de produire des objets qui se conditionnment eux-mêmes. 58

the forms become active when they organise themselves in relation to the ground, bringing anterior virtualities to actuality. 59

We can create technical beings because we have in us a play of relations and a matter-form relation which is closely analogous to what we institute in the  technical object 60 {#making} {#device} {#body}

The principle of the individualization of the technical object through recurrent causality in an associated milieu allows us to think with more clarity certain technical ensembles and to know if we must treat them as technical individuals or organised collections of individuals. 61 {#ensemble} {#thought} {#making}

The principle of individuation of technical objects in an ensemble is that of sub-ensembles of recurrent causality in the associated milieu. All technical objects that have a recurrent causality in their associated milieu must be separated from each other and connected in ways that maintain the independence of associated milieus in relation to each other 63. {#ensemble} {#making} {#device}

Where is the individuality of the ensemble? At the level of the sub-ensemble or that of the ensemble? 64 {#ensemble} {#platform-definition}

definition of technical element: they don't have an  associated milieu 65

technical time proper: oscillations of relaxation running between different levels of the ensemble from elements to individuals to ensembles. 66-67 {#ensemble} {#change}

technicity is the degree of concretisation of the object 72 {#technicity}

associated milieu is depositary of technicity at the level of the individual, as extension of it is inter-commutativity at the level of the ensemble 73 {#ensemble} {#technicity}

in the elements, technicity exists in the most pure form, whereas in the individuals and the ensembles it only exists in state of combinations 73 {#ensemble} {#combination}

> It is as if, in its totality, the tool was made of a plurality of functionally different zones, welded together. The tool is made not only of form and matter; it is made of elaborate technical elements according to a certain schema of functioning and assembled into a stable structure through the operation of fabrication. The tool unites within itself the results of the functioning of a technical ensemble. In order to make a good adze a technical ensemble of a foundry, forge, and quench hardening is required. The technicity of the object is thus more than a quality of its use; it is that which, within it, adds itself to a first determination given by the relation between form and matter; it acts as an intermediary between form and matter, here for instance as the progressive heterogeneity of the quench hardening in different points. Technicity is the degree of the objects concretization. 72

>These types of steel express the result of the functioning of a technical ensemble comprising in equal measure the qualities of coal used, as well as the temperature and chemical composition of the soft water of the Furan river, or the species of green wood used to stir and refine the molten metal prior to casting. In certain cases, technicity becomes predominant with respect to the abstract aspects of the relation between matter and form.
capacity or puissance of elements increases as it concretises 74 and the wider the conditions of usages 75.

stable technical individuals and technical ensembles only sometimes exist; often they are temporary 76 {#ensemble} {#change}

often people become the associated milieu for an ensemble 77 {#experience} {#ensemble}

machine often replaces human as carrier of tools 78

it is still the human who conserves in himself the centre of the complex technical individual that is the reality constituted by human and machine. 79

but people can remain as associated milieu for machine 79

the two positions that people occupy in relation to ensemble: element or chef 82 {#experience} {#ensemble}

technicity is not a hierarchisable reality 81 -- exists from element to ensemble, but the effect of ensemble is more prominent due to the role attributed to the chef 81 {#technicity} {#platform-elites}

## Part 2: human and technical object

### ch1 - 2 fundamental relations of human to techniques

connaturity with elements -- no sentiment or attachment 89

2 types of relation to technical object -- the connaturity approach and the encyclopaedisme approach  93

plates and schemas and their importance to the technical object 93  - new mode of instruction;

encyclopaedisme as a new social force 94

visual symbolisme appropriate to technology  - forms and proportions (97), and the word gives way to the image.   {#images} {#technicity} {#diagram}

105 -112: interesting discussion of difference between children and adult relation to technical object; and how culture makes of adult simultaneity the successive virtuality of adolescence. 112 for this conclusion. 

### ch 2: regulative function of culture in the relation between human and the world of technical object

- techniques as treated in encyclopaedisme: enthusiams attest to discovery of the  technicity of technical element 113

- alienation more profound than relation of property -- discontinuity between technical and human  117-118

capital and labour are both incomplete modes of being in relation to the  technicity of the technical object. 

for both, the finality counts more than the scheme of action 119

by contrast, in the technical individual, the externality of finality disappears in the face of growing internal coherence 119 the auto-regulation takes over 

Intuition of schemes of functioning supports a relation to technical being for human 119

Discussion of difference between inorganic and living memory 120-122

Coupling of human and machine starts when a common coding has been discovered 124 {#coding}

quite long discussion of synchronisation and how it works -- need for critical points

machines that can receive information are those that localise their indetermination 141


## conclusion

There is work when the human can not confer on the technical object the function of mediation between species and nature, and must accomplish this function himself, through his body, his thought, his action 242

the human who works prepares the mediation but does not accomplish it 243

when the human no longer intervenes as carrier of tools, he cannot leave the centre of the operation in obscurity. It is in effect this centre that must be produced by the  technical object, which does not think, which does not feel and which does not contract habits. 244

technical activity is neither part of a pure social domain or pure psychic domain. It is the model of the collective relation, which cannot be confounded with either of the trow preceding 245 {#work} {#ensemble}

the technical world offers an indefinite availability of groupings and connections 246 {#participation}

it is functioning and not work which characterises the technical object 246 {#function} {#work}

the technical object supplies a much more vast category than that of work: operational functioning 247 {#work}

operational functioning supposes at base as condition of possibility an act of invention 247 

L'object technique pris selon essence, c'est-à-dire l'objet technique en tant qu'il a été inventé, pensé et voulu, assumé par un sujet humaine, devient le support et le symbol de cette relation que nous voudrions nommer transindividuelle. 247 

The technical object, taken according to its essence, this is to say, the technical object in as much it has been invented, thought and desired,  taken on by a human subject, becomes the support and the symbol of this relation that we would like to call transindividual. {#ensemble} {#experience}

through the intermediary of the technical object an interhuman relation creates itself, which is the model of transindividualité 248

one could say that there is human nature in technical being, in the sense where the word nature could be employed to designate what remains origine, anterior even to humanity constituted in man 248

work conceived as productive, in the measure where it stems from the individual localised here and now, cannot account for invented technical being; it is not the individual who invents, it is the subject, larger than the individual, more rich than it, and comprising, in addition to the individuality of the individuated being, a certain change of nature, of non-individuated being  248

the activity of reglage (adjustment, tuning, control)  is the one which prolongs most naturally the function of invention and construction.: the reglage is a perpetuated invention, albeit limited 250 {#regulation} {#making}

it is necessary that the genesis of the  technical object effectively becomes part of its existence, and that the relation of human to technical object comprises this attention to the continued genesis of the technical object. 250 {#platform-positive} {#responsibility} {#change}

so that information can be exchanged, it is necessary the humans possess in themselves a technical culture, that is to say, an ensemble of forms which, encountering forms supplied by the machine, could sustain a signification. The machine remains one of the obscure zones of our civilization at all social levels 252 {#ensemble} {#thought}

the foundation of norms and right in the industrial domain is neither work nor property but technicity 252 {#inequality-gender} {#ensemble}

## older stuff

[L]es objets apparaissent à un certain moment, mais le technicité les précède et les dépasse; les object techniques résultent d'une objectivation de la technicité; ils sont produite par elle, mais la technicité ne s'épuise pas dans les objects et n'est pas tout entière contenue en eux 163


Il n'y a pas d'auto-regulation purement interne, entièrement isoleé; les résultats de l'action sont des résultats non seulement en eux-mêmes mais aussi par leur rapport au milieu extériur, à l'ensemble. ... Le type de mémoire et le type de perception qui conviennent à cet aspect de la régulation nécessitent l'intégration, la transformation d'a posteriori en a prior que le vivant seul réalise en lui. 125

La machine résulte de son essence. Au contraire, l'homme n'est pas une monade, car en lui, l'a posteriori devient a priori,  l'evenement principe. 126


Par l'intermédiare de 'objet technique se crée alors une relation interhumaine qui est le modèle de la transindividualité. On peut entendre par là une relation  qui ne met pas les individus en rapport au moyen de leur individualité constituée les séparent les uns des autres, ni au moyen  de ce qu'il y a identique en tout sujet humain, par exemple les formes a priori     de la sensibilité, mais au moyen de cette charge de réalité pré-individuelle, de cette charge de nature qui est conservée avec l'être individuel, et qui contient potentiels et virtualité. 248

L'object technique apprecie et connu selon son essence, c'est a dire selon l'acte humain d'invention qui l'a fonde, penetre d'intelligibilite fonctionelle, valorise selon  ses normes internes, apporte avec lui une information pure.  … ce qui est connu dans l'object technique, c'est la forme, cristallisation materielle d'une scheme operatoire et d'une pensee qui a resolu un probleme. Cette forme, pour etre comprise, necessite dans le sujet des forms analogues. 247

Par l'intermediare de l'objet technique se cree une relation interhumaine qui est le modele de la transindividualite. On peut  entendre par la une relation qui ne met les individus en rapport au moyen de leur individualite constitue les separant les uns des autres, ni au moyen de ce qu'il ya a d'identique en tout sujet humain, part example les formes a priori de la sensibilite, mais au moyen de cette charge preindividuelle, de cette charge de nature qui est conserve avec l'etre individuel, et qui contient potentials et virtualite. 248

La relation a l'objet technique ne peut pas devenir adequate individu par individu, sauf en case tres rare et isoles; elle ne peu s'instituer que dans la mesure ou elle arrivera a faire exister cette realite interindividuelle collective, que nous nommons transindividuelle, parce qu'elle cree un couplage entre les capacites inventives et organisatrices de plusieurs sujets 253

Cette realite de fond qui sous-tend le geste technique est le dynamisme des choses, ce par quoi elles sont productrices, ce qui leur donne une fecondite, une efficacite, une energie utilisable. C'est la chose comme pouvoir et non comme structure que la technique recherche. 203

>The technical object in fact distinguishes itself from the scientific object because the scientific object is an analytical object, which aims at analyzing a unique effect in all its most precise conditions and characteristics, whereas the technical object, far from being situated in its entirety within the context o f a particular science, is in fact at a point of concurrence of a multitude of data and scientific effects coming from the most varied domains, integrating what appear to be the most heteroclite forms of knowl­ edge [savoirs ], and which can in some cases not be coordinated intellectually, while they are indeed coordinated practically in the functioning of the technical object; it has been said that the technical object is the result of the art of compromise; what it is, is indeed an eminently synthetic structure, which cannot be understood in any other way than through the introduction of a synthetic schematism that presides over invention. The technical schema, which is a relation between several structures and a complex operation taking place through these structures, is by its very nature encyclopedic, since it leads to a circularity of knowledge, a synergy of elements of knowledge that are still theoretically heterogeneous. 124-125 English edition
