Science must matter for the public which is thereby defined as mere opinion, to be convinced that it is its only chance to escape irrational belief and blind interests. 159
However, there may be a small precarious, possibility, part of our epoch, that a new kind of public is emerging, and that such a public may be able to make another kind of difference. ... These may be called “objecting minorities,” minorities producing not as their aim but in the very process of their emergence the power to object and to intervene in matters which they discover concern them. They emergence of this divergent, problem-creating, multiple, “empowered” minorities is what I would define as the unknown of our epoch. 160
The awful, despicable pragmatic “it works” may then become a matter of concern, of evaluation, not of disqualification.  161
To repeat the precarious political pragmatic hope I presented, it is only if we become able, as philosophers, to put scientific achievements on the same plane of immanence together with other diverging conventions, each with its demanding definition of what matters, that we can stop poisoning this hope, that we can share, instead, the pragmatic concern for the itinerant process of creation of new ‘‘it works’’ as they mark the process of empowerment of new minorities, with new actively diverging ‘‘habits’’ that must be celebrated each time as something new entering the world and indeed as modifying it.162

We should not forget that the very possibility of  associating science, art, and philosophy to creation first testifies for a depopulated world. These are practices that are now in danger of lacking resistance to the present, of being appropriated, but they are also the surviving ones, the ones which were tolerated or domesticated, ‘‘encasted’’while so many others were destroyed by what we call ‘‘modernization.’’ As a result, these practices must also be considered from the point of view of the price they pay for their domesticated or tolerated survival: diverging prices but heavy ones anyway. 162

This is why the power of such a convention changes in nature as soon as it leaves its birthplace and concerns human affairs where all protagonists are not enabled to object, where some are a priori defined as not mattering. The effectuation of the event, the meaning of the ‘‘it works,’’ radically changes as soon as the tent is pitched on the settled ground of interests and power, and as soon as the habit of the public to accept being addressed as powerless, mere opinion, unable to object and propose, is an ingredient in its concept (Stengers, 2005, 162). 

No function can deal with learning, producing, or empowering new habits, as all require and achieve the production of different worlds, non-consensual worlds, actively diverging worlds (Stengers, 2005, 162).
