in the twenty-first century advanced capitalism came to be centred upon extracting and using a particular kind of raw material: data 39

What are platforms? At the most general level, platforms are digital infrastructures that enable two or more groups to interact. They therefore position themselves as intermediaries that bring together different users: customers, advertisers, service providers, producers, suppliers and even physical objects. 43

The second essential characteristic is that digital platforms produce and are reliant on 'network effects': the more numerous the users who use a platform, the more valuable that platform becomes for everybody else. 45

Finally, platforms are designed in a way that makes them attractive to its varied users. 46

Platforms, in sum, are a new type of firm; they are characterised by providing the infrastructure to intermediate between different user groups, by displaying monopoly tendencies driven by network effects, by employing cross-subsidisation to draw in different user groups, and by having a designed core architecture that governs the interaction possibilities. 48

Platform ownership, in turn, is essentially ownership of software (the 2 billion lines of code for Google, or the 20 million lines of code for Facebook) and hardware (servers, data centres, smartphones, etc.) built upon open-source material (e.g. Hadoop's data management system is used by Facebook). ... They are an extractive apparatus for data. 48


They are an extractive apparatus for data 48

five different types of platforms: advertising, cloud, industrial, product, lean 49 - the bulk of ch2 describes these types

WIth network effects, a tendency towards monopolisation is built into the DNA of platforms: the more numerous the users who interact on  a platform, the more valuable the entire platform becomes for each one of them. 95

Yet expansion is also driven by factors other than user demand. On such factor is the drive for further data extraction. 98

Such is the importance of data that many companies could make all of their software open-source and still maintain their dominant position due to their data. 99

consumer IoT is only fully intelligible as a platform-driven extension of data recording into everyday activities. 100

This tendency involved constantly pressing against the limits of what is socially and legally acceptable in terms of data collection. 101. 

Bottlenecks in the flow of data from sensors to commodity are an impediment to producing more values. The result is a tendency to increasingly take on all the features of the stack, from hardware to software. 103

As the primary means by which users interact with platforms, interfaces occupy a key intermediary position in the broader ecosystem. 104

Ultimately we see convergence -- and therefore competition -- across the field. 109

A third dominant tendency is the funnelling of data extraction into siloed platforms. 110

use enclosure as a key means of competing against their rivals. 113

In terms of profitability, Amazon is more the future than Google, Facebook or Uber 126

The state, by contrast, has the power to control platforms. 127

a way to siphon off capital into a relatively dynamic sector oriented towards the mining of data 128

More radically, we can push for postcapitalist platforms that make use of the data collected by these platforms in order to distribute resources, enable democratic participation, and generate further technological development. Perhaps today we must collectivise the platforms. 128
