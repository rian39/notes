{Miller, 2000 #12}
In this regard, we find ourselves quite alienated from that earlier generation of Internet writing that was concerned with the Internet primarily through such notions as 'cyberspace' or 'virtuality'. These terms focused on the way in which the new media seemed able to constitute spaces or places apart from the rest of social life ('real life' of offline life), spaces in which new forms of sociality were emerging, as well as bases for new identities, such as new relations to gender, 'race', or ontology. (4)
By focusing on 'virtuality' as the defining feature of may Internet media and then moving on to notions such as 'cyberspace', we start from an assumption that it is opposed to and disembedded from the real. (4)
Like the term 'simulation', 'virtuality' points to a representational 'as if' that is separate from but can substitute for the 'really is'. But by focusing on 'virtuality' as the defining feature of the many Internet media and then moving on to notions such as 'cyberspace', we start from an assumption that it is opposed to and disembedded from the real. (4)
Internet media position people within networks that transcend their immediate location, placing them in wider flows of cultural, political and economic resources. The boundaries of markets, nations, cultures and technologies become increasingly permeable, and require people to think of themselves as actors on ever more global stages (18-19)
