What is precarity, indeterminacy, and what we imagine as trivial are the centre of the systematicity we week? 20

The concept of _assemblage_ is helpful. Ecologists turned to assemblages to get around the sometimes fixed and bounded connatations of ecological "community." The question of how the varied species in a species assemblage influence each other -- if at all -- is never settled: some thwart (or eat) each other; others work together to make life possible; still others just happen to find themselves in the same place. Assemblages are open-ended gatherings. ... Patterns of unintentional coordination develop in assemblages 22-23 {#assemblage}
