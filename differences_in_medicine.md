Introduction 3

few years ago Donna Haraway wrote: "But if there has been recognition of the many non-, para-, anti-, or extrascientific languages in company with biomedicine that structure the embodied semiosis of mortality in the industrialized world, it is much less common to find emphases on the multiple language within the territory that is so often glibly marked scientific." Haraway 1991: 204.

The image of a unified medicine gives way to one that overflows with diversity. But how is this diversity to be understood? Is it not a mere artifact, an effect of corning ever closer to the messiness of practice? What is its relevance? Introduction 7

First. diversity is sometimes taken to be a problem, something to fight against 7

A second way to conceive of diversity is to imagine that however impressive may look on the surface, a deeper unity hides behind it38 au unity that is all the stronger because of its disguise. 7

if diversity neither hides a fundamental diversity nor signals a freedom that deserves celebration then what does it do? That question, we think, is precisely what requires investigation. Our studies show both unifying and disruptive forces; both continuities and discontinuities. They point at tensions among shaping practices, bodies, and lives in various diverging ways: tensions between making the world run in this, rather than in some other way. 7 {#differences} {#biomedicine}
