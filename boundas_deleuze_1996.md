Boundas, Constantin. "Deleuze-Bergson: An Ontology of the Virtual." In Deleuze : A Critical Reader, edited by Paul Patton, x, 316 p. Oxford ; Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 1996.
Just like Kant, Deleuze believes that Ideas are problem-setting imperatives. But unlike Kant, Deleuze believes that the ability of a problem to be solved must be made to depend on the form that the problem takes. 88
The Idea then would differ in nature from all the solutions to which it is susceptible. It would transcend all the solutions to which it gives rise. 89
They are multiplicities, systems of differential elements, singular problem-setting structures. 89
Representation belongs essentially to consciousness and follows the logic of solutions. The Idea, on the contrary, is in Deleuze's expression, 'sub-representative' and it is fashioned according to the logic of the problem and of the question. 89
