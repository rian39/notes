While the image does not change, in appreciating its same components in a different way you may suddenly experience a different observation, where the foreground and the background, or the artifact and the object, shift. This is when people stop saying, “I see a duck” and start to say, “I see it as a duck.” Wittgenstein calls this moment “the dawning of aspect”: a change in the organization of visual experience. Although the object does not change, this change of aspect produces a different observation, “quite as if the object had altered before my eyes.” [@Vertesi_2015,9] {#images}

Visualization in science, then, is not a question of creating an ever truer or more singular image of an object. Rather, it is a practical activity of drawing a natural object as an analytical object, inscribing a value into the very composition of what that object is and what makes it interesting, so that subsequent viewers and image makers will see, draw, and interact with that same object in the same way. 109 {#images}

The scientific image itself does not so much document the object out there as document the work of different communities of knowing subjects that enable, produce, and constrain knowledge of the world. 109 {#images}

These actions and interactions compose the image into something meaningful, distinguishing foreground from background and object from artifact. Thus an interpretation or skilled vision is crafted into the image from the outset, so that the resulting picture incorporates elements of what it ought to be seen as. This is the work of drawing as. 79


Digital image processing, to a large extent, constitutes the essence of “doing science” on another planet. 87
