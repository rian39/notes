>In most cases this definition is further expanded to include the processes that link these scales and spaces. In practice biodiversity did not emerge anew. It came out of and is thoroughly dependent on the embodied, affective, and technological encounters between multiple species that I describe in the previous chapter. Biodiversity happens in an assemblage. It inherits and is haunted by particular knowledges, habits, instruments, territories, and practices. [@Lorimer_2015, 58]


>These include knowledge practices for identifying, classifying, counting, surveying, mapping, and calculating. Databases and models are key here. These knowledge practices inform practical management actions like culling, fencing, translocating, vaccinating, breeding, and planting. [@Lorimer_2015, 58]

I present biodiversity as a form of environmental governance actively shaping human and nonhuman subjects and the wider ecologies they inhabit. 59

I trace how biodiversity conservationists “cut up” 10 the flux of the wildlife to create the units, theories, models, and territories that come to inform practical action. I examine the derivation and performance of a framing of wildlife that departs from the panoptic aspirations of the official definition of biodiversity to focus on a charismatic set of species. 58

Figure 4 important and may need to be reproduced: 

> As a consequence the biopolitical assemblage illustrated in Figure 4 can be understood as an “oligopticon,” 22 an inevitable and necessary, but nonetheless partial, framing at odds with the panoptic aspirations of biodiversity. 64

> Paradoxically, as biodiversity flourishes as a governance regime so the nonhuman difference it seeks to conserve continues to ebb. Agriculture, fishing, forestry, and other productive forms of environmental management continue to take their toll. 66

>Here, I focus on four significant knowledge practices and performative interventions within the wider operations of UK biodiversity conservation. These help illustrate the utility of conceiving of biodiversity as biopolitics and help account for the operations and scope of the UKBAP oligopticon. I start with the use of species as the primary ontological unit for biodiversity before describing spe- cies description, surveillance, and action plan implementation. 66

Species are employed as the basic units for quantifying biodiversity and constitute the principal targets for conservation action. Although the UKBAP also identifies forty-five priority habitats for conservation, a subset of species is used as indicators for measuring their health and the efficacy of conservation actions. 67 

we can understand how species are much easier to tune in to than dynamic, invisible, and abstract entities such as ecosystems and genes. Discrete species—­ especially those that can be identified by morphological/audible differences—­provide accessible units for listing, counting, mapping, and auditing the success of conservation interventions. Species pro- vide a handy index of current ecological composition for monitoring change. 69

The foci and subsequent scope of taxonomy are strongly configured by the ecological charisma of the organisms to be described. Taxonomists’ preferences are also shaped by an organism’s corporeal charisma in relation to the knowledge practices and affective logics of systematics (the wider field of which taxonomy forms a part). Systematists’ interests extend well beyond inventory and collection and concern classification and evolution 70

Surveillance provides the data through which governance is planned and audited. 71

In practice, as I have traced, in the context of the United Kingdom biodiversity as biopolitics works within the ecological, corporeal, cultural, and institutional constraints that characterize the assemblage of UK nature conservation. It is dependent upon the material possibilities for field science, historic data, the real estate of nature reserves, and the resources of NGOs. 75
 
As Geoffrey Bowker notes in his work on biodiversity databases, assemblages are performative, anticipating and shaping the bodies and ecologies they purport to represent. 75

There is a clear taxonomy among these species as to the degree of interest, knowledge, resources, and institutional support they receive. Birds, large plants, mammals, and some groups of invertebrates, like butterflies and beetles, have been popular. The vast majority of invertebrates have been relatively neglected. This analysis suggests that UK conservation is guided less by the panoptic logic of biodiversity and more by a taxonomy of nonhu- man charisma that emerges out of the encounters detailed in chapter 2. This taxonomy is embedded within the institutional assemblages that perform conservation. 75
