To learn to speak appropriately about it, let us recognize that technological trajectories are not easy to grasp and that they do not go straight—no more than do the beings responsible for the establishment of chains of reference [tec · ref] . Everything in the practice of artisans, engineers, technicians, and even weekend putterers brings to light the multiplicity of transformations, the heterogeneity of combinations, the proliferation of clever artifices, the delicate setups of fragile skills. If this experience remains difficult to register, it is because to remain faithful to it we would have to accept its scarcity, its dazzling invisibility, its deep constitutional opacity. For it is always oscillating between two lists of contradictory elements: rare and ordinary, unforeseeable and predictable, fleeting and constantly begun anew, opaque and transparent, proliferating and controlled 216 {#ensemble}

No doubt about it, to write up the specifications of these beings the analyst is going to have to take into account, simultaneously, the detour, this zigzagging course, the delegation that makes the action reliant on other materials, and the oblivion that the beings leave behind once the new composition has been established. In this, they differ from the beings of metamorphosis, which cannot be forgotten for a second: if you forget them, they will “get” you around the next corner. Technology, for its part, seeks to be forgotten. Definitely, it is about technology rather than nature that we can say “it likes to hide.” 217 {#method} {#diagram}

We shall never find the mode of technological existence in the object itself, since it is always necessary to look beside it: first, between the object itself and the enigmatic movement of which it is only the wake; then, within the object itself, between each of the components of which it is only the temporary assemblage. And the same thing applies to the skillful gestures that the artisan eventually makes habitual, after long practice: when we began to establish them, they required the presence of a technological detour 221 {#ambivalence} {#ambiguity}

As we can see, the adjective “technological” does not designate in the first place an object, a result, but a movement that is going to take from inert entities and from living ones—including the body of the artisan, which becomes more skillful by the day—what is needed to hold together in a lasting way, to freeze, as it were, one of the moments of metamorphosis. 225

Technology always entails folds upon folds, implications, complications, explanations. Its canonical representation, thoroughly studied by the sociology of technologies, sketches it in the form of a series, often a very long series, of nested translations , a labyrinth. There is technical folding every time we can bring to light this second-level transcendence that comes to interrupt, bend, deflect, cut out the other modes of existence, and thus by a clever ploy introduces a differential of materials.228 

quasi subjects, have sprung up little by little from what they were doing. This is why we had to be so suspicious of the concept of “action on matter,” which threatened to place the point of departure in the depths of a human subject instead of waiting for this human subject to emerge from his works—though the possessive adjective is quite unwarranted, because the human subject does not master “his” works any more than he possesses them. 229  {#practice} {#participation}

it is better to reverse the viewpoint and bring to the surface the encounter with one of those beings that teach you what you are when you are making it one of the future components of subjects (having some competence, knowing how to go about it, possessing a skill). Competence, here again, here as everywhere, follows performance rather than preceding it. In place of *Homo faber,* we would do better to speak of *Homo fabricatus,* daughters and sons of their products and their works. The author, at the outset, is only the effect of the launching from behind, of the equipment ahead. If gunshots entail, as they say, a “recoil effect,” then humanity is above all the recoil of the technological detour. 230  {#making}

To keep open opportunities for negotiation over the successors of the contemporary production arrangements, it is crucial to restore to the beings of technology a capacity for combination that liberates them entirely from the heavy weight of instrumentality. Freedom of maneuver that is indispensable in order to invent the arrangements to be set up when we have to dismantle the impossible modernization front . If the verb “ ecologize ” is to become an alternative to “modernize,” we shall need to establish quite different transactions with technological beings. 231 {#platform-positive}
