Presents the technique in the context of 'belief networks' and expert systems

A very simple example may help to fix ideas. Suppose the input $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a set of $m$ feature $x_i, ..., x_m$. As usual, we wish to find the posterior probabilities $p(k|\boldsymbol{x}) to classify a future case. The rule called _naive_ or _idiot's_ Bayes .. takes:

$$p(k|\boldsymbol{x})  ...  $$ 244

The qualitative part of naive Bayes can be expressed graphically as in Figure 8.1
