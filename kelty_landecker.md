what we propose is highly specific empirical work on the general, through developing a specific approach to the massive bodies of literature produced in this period, an approach we think if as treating The Literature as an informant. This approach is a deliberate anthropomorphization of this ‘body’ as something to be observed and engaged as something alive with concepts and practices not necessarily visible through the lens of single actors, institutions or key papers. 177 

Reading across a large number of journal articles for emplotment can give one a better sense of the emergence and disappearance of disciplines, styles of reasoning or collective projects related to national goals or the commercialization of science. 187

Problematization can also an interpretive act on the part of the analyst: looking for ways in which articles array themselves around a particular problem to be solved in the future, as well as looking for ways that articles reinterpret past work as a resource for new problems. 187

Reading for problematizations can be understood, perhaps, as a contribution to historical epistemology in an era when reading practices, and hence definitions of understanding, must confront the massive amount of literature being produced in the 20th century. 188l

it means that one can read for practice; one can even imagine an intellectual history of practice, as practices and their assumptions contain concepts of how humans should act upon the natural world 3 . Quantitative tools can be used to map the movement of techniques carried out under the sign of hybridization, with citational patterns compared to other modes of connection – word usage, co-authorship or co-publication, geographical location, model organism, material specimen or experimental system; these tools can also track shifts in scientific attention and production.
