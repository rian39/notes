Glyn Moody, Rebel Code. Linux and the Open Source Revolution, (Penguin, 2001).

“I was testing the task-switching capabilities, so what I did was I just made two processes and made them write to the screen and had a timer that switched tasks. One process wrote 'A', the other wrote 'B', so I saw 'AAAABBBB' and so.” Later, Linus would write of this task-switcher, “Gods I was proud over that” (Moody, 2001, 36)
