Political action in the network, then, can be be guided deliberatory by human actors, or accidentally affected by nonhuman actors (...). Often, tactical misuse of a protocol, be it intended or unintended, can identify the political fissures in a network. 30-31

Thus any kind of protocological contol exists not because the network is smooth and continuous but precisely because the network contains within it antagonistic clusterings, divergent subtopologies, rogue nodes. (This is what makes them networks; if they were not internally heterogeneous, they would be known as integral wholes). 34 {#network}

It is the management of this unity-heterogeneity flow that is most important. In terms of protocological control, the question of individuation is a question of how discrete nodes (agencies) and their edges (actions) are identified and managed as such. 60

An important future political problem will no longer be the alienation of real social relations into objects, but the extraction of abstract code from objects. In other words, codification not reification, is the new concern. 134

This is the first step in activating an ethics and a politics of networks, an activation of a political consciousness that is as capable of the critiquing of protocological control as it is capable of fostering the transformative elements of protocol. What would a network form of praxis be like? 100
