Landecker, Hannah. Culturing Life : How Cells Became Technologies. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007.

The cell is making a particular kind of reappearance as a central actor in today's biomedical, biological,and biotechnical settings.  …. At the beginning of the twenty-first centry, the cell has emerged as a central unit of biological thought and practice. The cell has deposed the gene as the candidate for the role of “life itself.” 4-5

The Tissue Culture Association (TCA）was central to the rapid standardization of both materials and practices. 134
The “standard” tissue culture stocks such as HeLa and L cells (standard although only established a few short years before) were thus shown to be composed of many different “individuals” - once those individuals were isolated, they displayed characterics different from those of the stock culture as a whole.  149
[t]he demands of cultivation of living matter as an integral part of its manipulation again directs attention to cellular media and, more broadly, to the situation of the living thing when the laboratory, biotechnology, and contemporary life science are its milieu. 152
When the thoroughly empirical - ….- tinkering with apparatus and chemistry showed certain things to be achievable, the boundaries around what one could do to living cells were shown to be manipulable. 159
As observers, we are given unreasonably sturdy, highly visible, ready-made categories of the relevance of biotechnology to they human 224
As an approach to the living, biotechnology changes what it is to be biological, a step that must be analyzed before leaping straight into how biotechnology changes what it is to be human. 233

Keeping an eye on practical, protocols, methods, technique, touch, or infrastructure provides access to the ways in which work on some life (nematodes, insects, yeast) reshapes human life by intorducting systematic change into biological existence. Perhaps more importantly, this methodological focus on genres of technique and infrastructures of research allows room for the vast realms of contemporary biological practical and biotechnological intervention that are not based directly on human matter or health or reproduction. 234
