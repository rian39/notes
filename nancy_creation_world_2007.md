The stance of a world is the experience it makes of itself. Experience (the experiri) consists in traversing to the end: a world is traversed from one edge to the other, and nothing else. 43
The world is thus outside representation, outside its representation and of a world of representation, and this is how, no doubt, one reaches the most contemporary determination of the world. 43
In the transformations of the evaluations of value, which are the transformations of the production of the ways of life, the technological and cultural processes are inextricably joined and in reciprocal relation. 48
One could say that worldhood is the symbolization of the world, the way in which the world symbolizes in itself with itself, in which it articulates itself by making a circulation of meaning possible without reference to another world. 53
In excess or in deficiency with respect to its work does not mean outside of all labor, but means a labor whose principle is not determined by a goal of mastery (domination, usefulness, appropriation), but exceeds all submission to an end – that is, also exposes itself to remain without end. 54
