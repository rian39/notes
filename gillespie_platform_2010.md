The discourse of the ‘platform’ works against us developing such precision, offering as it does a comforting sense of technical neutrality and progressive openness. 360

As these providers become the curators of public discourse, we must examine the roles they aim to play, and the terms by which they hope to be judged. 347

- uses self-description by providers to do the analysis

Intermediaries like YouTube and Google, those companies that provide storage, navigation and delivery of the digital content of others, are working to establish a long-term position in a fluctuating economic and cultural terrain. 348 

The term ‘platform’ helps reveal how YouTube and others stage themselves for these constituencies, allowing them to make a broadly progressive sales pitch while also eliding the tensions inherent in their service: between user-generated and commercially-produced content, between cultivating community and serving up advertising, between intervening in the delivery of content and remaining neutral. In the process, it is offering up a trope by which others will come to understand and judge them. 348

I want to begin by highlighting four semantic territories that the word ‘platform’ has signified in the past 348

- Computational, architectural, figurative, political 

All four of these semantic areas are relevant to why ‘platform’ has emerged in reference
to online content-hosting intermediaries and, just as important, what value both its speci-
ficity and its flexibility offer them. All point to a common set of connotations: a ‘raised
level surface’ designed to facilitate some activity that will subsequently take place. It is
anticipatory, but not causal. 351

In fact, nearly every surge of research and investment pursued by the digital industry –
e-commerce, web services, online advertising, mobile devices and digital media sales –
has seen the term migrate to it. Though nearly all of these still refer to, if not a
computational infrastructure, than at least a technical base upon which other programs
will run, certainly the term was already exceeding this semantic boundary. 351

This offer of access to everyone comes fitted with an often implicit, occasionally
explicit, counterpoint: that such services are therefore unlike the mainstream broadcast-
ers, film studios and publishers. Unlike Hollywood and the television networks, who
could be painted as the big bad industries, online content seems an open world, where
anyone can post, anything can be said. 353

Google and YouTube have also positioned themselves as champions of freedom of
expression, and ‘platform’ works here too, deftly linking the technical, figurative and
political. 356

Despite the promises made, ‘platforms’ are more like traditional media than they care
to admit. As they seek sustainable business models, as they run up against traditional
regulations and spark discussions of new ones, and as they become large and visible
enough to draw the attention not just of their users but of the public at large, the pres-
sures mount to strike a different balance between safe and controversial, between
socially and financially valuable, between niche and wide appeal. And, as with broad-
casting and publishing, their choices about what can appear, how it is organized, how it
is monetized, what can be removed and why, and what the technical architecture allows
and prohibits, are all real and substantive interventions into the contours of public dis-
course. 359
