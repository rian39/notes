Jurassic Park, 41:08 

X (tapping the screen) Vehicle headlights are on and they're not responding. They shouldn't be running off car batteries. Item 151 on today's glitch list. We have all the problems of a major theme park and a major zoo, and this group's not even on its feet yet.

Old guy: Dennis, our lives are in your hands and you have butter fingers?

Dennis (chortling, and spinning around from his screen): I am totally unappreciated in my time. You can run this whole park from this room with minimal staff for up to 3 days. Do you think that kind of automation is easy? (Drinks from pop can) Or cheap? You know anybody who can network 8 Connection Machines, and debug 2 million lines of code for what I bid for this job? Because if you can, I'd love to see them try (eats some candy). {#coding}

Old guy: I'm sorry about your financial problems Dennis, I really am. But they are your problems.

Dennis: Oh you're right John, you're absolutely right. You know everything's my problem.

John: I will not get drawn into another financial debate with you, Dennis, I really will not.

Dennis: There's been hardly any debate at all.

John: I don't blame people for their mistakes. But I do ask that they pay for them.

Dennis: Thanks Dad.

John: Dennis

X: Dennis! The headlights. 

Dennis: Yeah, I'll debug the tool program when they get back.Ok? It'll eat a lot of compute cycles. You'll lose part of the system for a while. You know there's a finite amount of memory. You can't use it for everything

Mr GameKeeper: Quiet! All of you
