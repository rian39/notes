<!--StartFragment-- !--StartFragment--> Linux kernel release 2.0.xx

These are the release notes for linux version 2.0.  Read them carefully,
as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the
kernel, and what to do if something goes wrong. 

WHAT IS LINUX?

 Linux is a Unix clone written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with
 assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net.
 It aims towards POSIX compliance. 

 It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged
 Unix, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries,
 demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory
 management and TCP/IP networking. 

 It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
 accompanying COPYING file for more details. 

ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

 Linux was first developed for 386/486-based PCs.  These days it also
 runs on DEC Alphas, SUN Sparcs, M68000 machines (like Atari and Amiga),
 MIPS and PowerPC.
