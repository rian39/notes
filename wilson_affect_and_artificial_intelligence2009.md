# Wilson,  Affect and Artificial Intelligence, 2009

Sometimes machines are the very means by which we can stay alive psychically, and they can  just as readily be a means for affective expansion and amplification as for affective attenuation. This is especially the case of computational machines. 30

If machines can be accessed psychically in this way -- if they can become a means for exploring affect and self-states; or, sadly, if they can become (as they often do) the last prospect of emotional connection -- then there must be some kind of intrinsic affinity, some kind of intuitive alliance between the machinic and the affective, between calculation and feeling. 31
