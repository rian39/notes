An online “platform” is a programmable digital architecture designed to organize interactions between users— not just end users but also corporate entities and public bodies. It is geared toward the systematic collection, algorithmic processing, circulation, and monetization of user data. Single platforms cannot be seen apart from each other but evolve in the context of an online setting that is structured by its own logic. A “platform ecosystem” is an assemblage of networked platforms, governed by a particular set of mechanisms (explained in chapter ¬ 2) that shapes everyday practices. The Western ecosystem is mostly operated by a handful of big tech companies (Alphabet- Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft) whose infrastructural services are central to the ecosystem’s overall design and the distribution of data flows. Besides, we will explain how several types of sectoral platforms are developed that often seamlessly integrate with the infrastructural core, not just in market sectors such as transport and hospitality but also in public sectors such as education and health.
