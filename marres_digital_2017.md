# What is digital sociology?

# What makes digital technology social?

# Do we need new methods? 

# Are we researching society or technology?

Whether as object, method or platform

Platforms make available inform-actional formats which facilitate practical and analytic operations at the same time. 128.

Because platforms are far more explicitly designed to serve as research instruments, social media research is, on the one hand, confronted with a more narrow choice: either we go along with the research programmes that are built into the analytic interfaces of platforms (_social media as research instrument_), or we conduct social studies of platform technologies and practices (_social media as topic_). On the other hand, there is also a third option: we may refuse this methodological choice, on the ground that the distinction between the platform as instrument and platform as object is far more unstable than the above formulation of these two options recognizes. We then say that social media platforms present social enquiry with an inherently _ambiguous phenomenon._ 129 

_While we may set out to do social research with digital platforms, we may easily end up studying media-technological dynamics, and the other way around._ From this vantage point, 'platform capture' is an important _problem_ in digital social research, as it is in social life: when taking up digital instruments, social research puts itself at risk of losing sight of its formative concerns, as happens to other social actors who take up social media. We must therefore _not_ give up on the critical task of specifying, and re-specifying, our objects of enquiry, whether they be social, technological or other substantive aspects of the digital. 138

today we do not ask detailed, methodological questions like 'what exactly are we (or they) analyzing when we (or they) apply their algorithms to these data?' enough, and this may be partly due to a perceived lack of access, or relevance, of social research to the big data-sets, instruments and machines of computational social science. 142

# Who are digital sociology's publics?

a new numerical infrastructure with the capacity to transform economic, cultural and political relations across society 156-7

Digital platforms open up spaces of multi-valence: in these spaces, action is measured, structured -- and valued -- according to multiple logics at once: everydya life, commerice, politics, knowledges, and so on. 157 

# Does digital sociology have problems

Are emerging digital infrastructures, arrangements and practices of data capture, analysis and feedback unsettling taken-for-granted relations between social research and social life; between the subjects, agents and audiences of social enquiry; between data, method and publics? 178

Some of the issues raised by digital research precisely have to do with the methodological frameworks implemented in computational social science. _Forms of knowledge_ have become the focal point of controversy in digital societies.  184

it is today in question what are the viable epistemic and methodological frameworks for digital social research 185

Crucial to the issues raised by digital ways of knowing society, I want to argue, is that they affect both social research and social life in equal measure. These issues are located on the interface of digital social research and digital social life.  185
