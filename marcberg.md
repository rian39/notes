[M]odels of the work, and/or through the processing of input into output formal tools are attributed central roles in organizing work within just about any modern workplace. What is it that these tools do in practice? How do they add to or interfere in the work performed? Answers to these questions are highly relevant for all those who believe that technology design might be improved through theoretical insight into the processes of everyday work. Yet any answer has to sail a risky course between either granting too much power and self-sufficiency to the tool at the expense of the workers (and thus replicating the rationalist discourses of ‘naive formalists' (Star, 1995)) or overly stressing the versatile and creative skill of the human workers versus the 'rigidity' of the formal tool. Both alternatives overlook how it is in the interrelation of the tool's functioning with the human workers' work that new potentialities emerge. 141-142
Only as part of a concrete work practice does a formal tool come to life. By itself it does not do anything: 142
To take this point further, the capacities and characteristics that formalists and their opponents attribute to the formal tool or to a human agent appear to be highly distributed.2 145
Zooming in on the way tool and work practice are interwoven, the distributed nature of the tasks comes into view - and thereby the way control and responsibility are transformed and dispersed over the heterogeneous assembly. We witness a myriad of little powers, together exhibiting capacities which the formalists would want to grant to the Formal tool, and their opponents would like to keep apart for the Human. The formal tools themselves are infinitely less powerful than the former would argue - but infinitely more than the latter claim. 147
Actual machines-in-use are not Machines, and instrumental reason is not what makes these hybrids tick. 148

Humans are not pitted against the formal: the tinkering activity is djrected at mending the drift in all juxtaposed elements. In addition. speaking about humans ‘saving' or ‘repairing' the formal tool re-installs the human in a position of control and oversight, and that is not what we encounter here. 151

The generative power of formal tools, then, lies in the very existence of the gap between the workpractice and its formal representation. Through deleting detail the map is functional in tracking a route between distant sites. 153
