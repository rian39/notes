But what is the ground? As a first approximation, we might suppose that it is a portion of the surface of the earth that is evident to the senses of an upright body. ‘To my senses’, wrote Immanuel Kant, the earth appears as ‘a flat surface, with a circular horizon’ (1933: 606). This surface, for Kant, lies at the very foundation of human experience: it is ‘the stage on which the play of our skills proceeds [and] the ground on which our knowledge is acquired and applied’ (Kant 1970: 257). Everything that exists and that might form the object of our perception is placed upon this surface, rather as properties and scenery might be set upon the stage of a theatre. Beneath the surface lies the domain of formless matter, the physical stuff of the world. s123

What for Kant was a stage became, for Marx, a production platform, not merely furnished but materially transformed through human activity. Yet the ground still appears as a substratum for such activity, an interface between the mental and the material where the sheer physicality of the world comes hard up against the creativity of human endeavour. s123


Even if we view the hill from a distance, we sense its rise in the ocular movement of our focal attention as it scans the upward-sloping line of the horizon. Moreover, far from comprising a featureless and perfectly level plane, the ground appears infinitely variegated. These variations are not just of contour but also of substance, colouration, and texture. 125

In the living world, however, the ground surface persists not in spite of reactions between substances and medium, but because of them. Indeed it is through such reactions that the ground is formed in the first place. 125

It is not, then, the surface of the earth that maintains the separation of substances and medium, or confines them to their respective domains. It is rather its surfacing. By this I mean the engineering of the ground surface by coating it with a layer of hard and resistant material such as concrete or asphalt, as in road building or laying the foundations for urban development. The objective of such engineering is to convert the ground into the kind of surface that theorists of modernity always thought it was – level, homogeneous, pre-existent and inert (Ingold 2008: 1808-9). It is to make the earth into a stage, platform, or baseboard, or, in a word, into an infrastructure, upon which the superstructure of the city can be erected. 126 {#platform}

. Let us, then, readmit the air as an essential material constituent of the inhabited world. This is easily done, yet is not without consequences for the way we think about our relations with the environment. One consequence is that we can no longer imagine that all such relations take the form of interactions between persons and things, or that they necessarily arise from the conjoint action of persons and things assembled in hybrid networks. 132

It seems to possess an agency of its own. Buoyed up by the wind and swooping in its currents, the kite strains at the thread linking it to the hand of the human flyer. On the ground the flyer, also bathed in the air, feels the tension in the thread, and ‘plays’ the kite by alternately loosening it and reining it in. An interaction is going on between the flyer and the kite, which is perhaps so close that one might better speak of the whole performance as the action of a flyer-kite hybrid. But this interaction could not take place were it not for the fact that both flyer and kite are jointly immersed in the current of air. Were the current stilled, the kite would crumple and drop, lifeless and inert like a dead bird. This leads me to one last observation. If the medium is a condition of interaction, then it follows that the quality of that interaction will be tempered by what is going on in the medium, that is, by the weather. 133

For inhabitants are wayfarers: they move through the world rather than across its outer surface. And their knowledge, as I shall now show, is not built up but grows along the paths they take, both on the ground and in the air.134

Rather, moving is knowing. The wayfarer knows as he goes along. Proceeding on his way, his life unfolds: he grows older and wiser. Thus the growth of his knowledge is equivalent to the maturation of his own person, and like the latter it continues throughout life. What distinguishes the expert from the novice, then, is not that the mind of the former is more richly furnished with content – as though with every increment of learning yet more representations were packed inside the head – but a greater sensitivity to cues in the environment and a greater capacity to respond to these cues with judgement and precision. The difference, if you will, is not one of how much you know but of how well you know. 134

The ground, in short, is continually coming into being along with its inhabitants. Like the tissues of plants and the bodies of animals, knowledge grows from the ground of the social. As inhabitants go their ways, following in the footsteps of predecessors, so the ground and the knowledge that grows from it are always in formation and never complete. Yet nothing would grow at all were it not for the currents of air that sweep the ground and the sunlight that bathes the bodies of its inhabitants. 136
