Culture ... is not so much a set of things – novels and paintings or TV programmes or comics – as a process, a set of practices. Primarily, culture is concerned with the production and exchange of meanings – the 'giving and taking of meaning' – between members of a society or group. ... Thus culture depends on its participants interpreting meaningfully what is around them, and 'making sense' of the world, in broadly similar ways. 
(Hall, Stuart  Representation : cultural representations and signifying practices Sage, 1997, 2)
