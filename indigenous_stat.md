And so it is that statistical analysis gets positioned in tension with Indigenous knowledge. As such, attempts to craft alternatives to the dominant and/or state-sponsored study of Indigenous peoples has largely rooted itself, we would argue somewhat irrationally, in opposition to statistical analysis.

Perceived ties between damaging research practices and quantitative methods are seen to align with the colonizer settler obsession of calculating and quantifying. That is, the seemingly unshakable reputation of quantitative research as embodying all that is wrong with research is largely built around a misplaced conflation of statistical techniques and processes within colonizer settler framed quantitative methodology with the method itself. Since colonization, this methodology and its purveyors have been enumerating and measuring the Indigenous peoples in support of our dispossession in our “captor nations” (Chartrand 1991). But it is the methodology, not the methods, that framed how this counting was used to first estimate the level of threat we posed to colonizing intentions, later to predict and confirm our apparent extinction, and contemporaneously to pejoratively compare us with the normalized majority.

Our point here is not that the results were necessarily startling. Rather, that the fact that these results can be “proved” in statistical terms means that they are taken seriously in a way that qualitative findings are not. The reason for this less problematic acceptance is again the settler obsession with measuring and quantifying as a way of making social phenomena not just understandable but real . This belief system can be used to position the validity and consequences of our research. In turn, the quantitative mantle of legitimacy can support our drive for an Indigenous prioritized research agenda.

Hence, Indigenous communities must become literate in the entire statistical cycle of the construction, collection, interpretation, and dissemination of quantitative information. Increasing our statistical literacy can open the possibility of levelling the relations of power within which statistical information is accorded its legitimacy in a manner that refusal or replacement with qualitative research cannot.
