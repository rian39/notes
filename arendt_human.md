The laws of statistics are valid only where large numbers or long periods are involved, and acts or events can statistically appear only as deviations or fluctations. The justification of statistics is that deeds and events are rare occurrences in everyday life and history. Yet the meaningfulness of everyday relationships is disclosed not in everyday life but in rare deeds, just as the significance of a historical period shows itself only in the few events that illuminate it. 42

The application of the law of large numbers and long periods to politics or history signifies nothing less than the wilful obliteration of their very subject matter, and it is a hopeless enterprise to search for meaning in politics or significance in history when everything that is not everyday behaviour or automatic trends has been ruled out as immaterial. 43

However, since the laws of statistics are perfectly valid when we deal with large numbers, it is obvious that every increase in population means an increased validity and a marked decrease of "deviation." Politically, this means that the larger the population in any given body politic, the more likely it will be the social rather than the political that constitute the public realm. 43

Since the rise of society, since the admission of household and housekeeping activities to the public realm, an irrestible tendency to grow, to devour the older realms of the political and private as well as the more recnelty established shpere of intimacy , has been one of the outstanding characterisits of the new realm. 45

 is decisive is the entirely un-Platonic subjection of geometry to algebraic treatment, which discloses the modern idea of reducing terrestrial sense data and movements to mathematical symbols. Without this non-spatial symbolic language Newton would not have been able to unite astronomy and physics into a single science, or to put it another way, to formulate a law of gravitation where the same equation will cover the movements of heavenly bodies in the sky and motion of terrestrial bodies on earth. Even then it was clear that modern mathematics, in an already breathtaking development, had discovered the amazing human faculty to grasp in symbols those dimensions and conceptues whcih at most had been thought of as negations and limitations of the mind, because their immensity seemed to transcend the minds of mere mortals, ... Yet even more significant than this possibility -- to reckon with entities which could not be "seen" by the eye of mind -- was the fact that the new mental instrument, in this respect even newer and more significant than all the scientific tools it helped to devise, opened the way for altogether novel mode of meeting and approaching nature in experiment. 265

In the experiment man realized his newly won freedom from the shackles of earth-bound experience; instead of observing natural phenomena as they were given to him, he placed nature under the conditions of his own mind, under conditions won from a universal, astrophyiscal standpoing, a cosmic viewpoint outside nature itself 265

With the rise of modernity, mathematics does not simply enlarge its content or reach out into the infinite to become applicable to the immensity of an infinite and infinitely growing, expanding universe, but ceases to be concerned with appearances at all. ... [it] becomes instead the science of the structure of the human mind 266

These are no longer ideal forms disclosed to the eye of the mind, but are the results of removing that eyes of the mind, no less than they eyes of the body, from the phenomena, of reducing all appearances through the force inherent in distance 267. 

Under this condition of remoteness, every assemblage of things is transformed into a mere multitude, and every multitude, no matter how disorder, incoherent, and confused, will fall into certain patterns and configurations possessing the same validity and no more significance than the mathematical curve, which as Leibniz once remarked, can always be found between points thrown at random on a piece of paper. 267


When Descartes' analytical geometry treated space and extension, the _res extensa_ of nature and the world, so "that its relations, however complicated, must always be epxressivle in algebraic formulae," mathematics succeeded in reducing and translating all that man is not into patterns which are identical with human, mental structures. 266

It was not reason but a man-made instrument, the telescope, which actually changed the physical world view; it was not contemplation, observation, and specualuation which led to the new knowledge, but the active stepping in of homo faber_, of making and fabricating. 274

Processes, therefore, and not ideas, the models and shapes of things to be, become the guide for the making and fabricating activities of _home faber_ in the modern age 300

The idea that only what I am going to make will be real -- perfectly true and legitimate in the realm of fabrication -- is forever defeated by the actual course of events, where nothing happens more frequently that the totally unexpected. 300

The capacity for action, as least in the sense of the releasing of processes, is still with us, although it has become the exclusive prerogative of the scientists, who have enlarged the realm of human affaire to the point of extinguishing the time-honored protective diving line between nature and the human world 323-324

But the action of the scientists, since it acts into nature from the standpoint of the universe and not into the web of human relationships, lacks the revelatory character of action as well as the ability to produce stories and become historical 324.
