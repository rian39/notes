I claimed in _The Emergence of Probability_ that our idea of probability is a  Janus-faced mid-seventheenth-century mutation in the Renaissance idea of signs. It came into being with a frequency aspect and a degree-of-belief aspect. 96

By the 1930s, however, the world teemed with frequencies, and the 'objective' notion would come to seem more important than the 'subjective' one for the rest of the century -- simply because there were soo many more frequencies to be known. 97

It is pointless to debate which of the two ideas is correct. We note only that one or the other may be more dominant at different times. 97

To return to _chance_ and _probabilite_: the fundamental distinction between 'objective' and 'subjective' in probability -- so often put in terms of frequency _vs._ belief -- is between modelling and inference. 98

stuff on the probability of a probabilility from Poisson -- 'the ('subjective') probability of an ('objective') probability, or, better, the _probabilite_ of a _chance_. 99

2 small steps in the taming of chance: one's psychological curve became a reality; introduce chance devices to control experimentation 205 [THIS CONCLUSION IS QUITE IMPORTANT -- build on this?]
One's psychological curve of error became an inferred, theoretical curve, which one cannot judge by introspection. It became a reality underneath the phenomena of consciousness. Secondly, Peirce deliberately used the properties of chance devices to introduce a new level of control into his experimentation. Control not by getting rid of chance fluctuations, but by adding some more. 205
