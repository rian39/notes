Caygill, Energy Life 2007 (Caygill 2007)
The nexus of life and energy is moreover axiomatic for contemporary research in biology and the neurosciences which are developing extremely sophisticated accounts of life and consciousness in terms of energy transfers, conservation and degradation. Yet in spite of the centrality of energy to the contemporary cultural and scientific doxa, the concept itself remains strangely unanalysed in contemporary philosophy and theory. Here, work continues to be pursued in terms of such archaic concepts as force and power. While such concepts may serve to introduce a dynamic element into contemporary theory – evident in such theoretical couplings as ‘corporeal force’ or ‘bio-power’ – they are historically anachronistic and conceptually limited in comparison with the concept of energy. Philosophy, however, very rarely reflects directly on the concept of energy, let alone the nexus between the concepts of energy and life. 19
From the two traditions emerged the discourse of energy or ‘thermodynamics’, but within it the physical tendency was dominant and the physiological recessive. 22
re Jacob account of the end of vis vita:
The triple flow of matter, energy and information is in fact a single flow, matter and information being but modes of energy. The emergence of the science of biology, in other words, depends on replacing the concept of vital force with that of energy. 22-23
nb: key idea that force, power are not the same as energy. Need to account for relations of energy, etc.
