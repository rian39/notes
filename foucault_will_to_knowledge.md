deployments of power and knowledge, of truth and pleasures, so unlike those of repression, are not necessarily secondary and derivative; and further, that repression is not in any case fundamental and overriding. We need to take these mechanisms seriously, therefore, and reverse the direction of our analysis: rather than assuming a generally acknowledged repression, and an ignorance measured against what we are supposed to know, we must begin with these positive mechanisms, insofar as they produce knowledge, multiply discourse, induce pleasure, and generate power. 73

The aim of the inquires that will follow is to move less toward a "theory" of power than toward an "analytics" of power: that is, toward a definition of the specific domain formed by relations of power, and toward a determination of the instruments that will make possible its analysis. However, it seems to me this analytics can be constituted only if it frees itself completely from  a certain representation of power that I would term ... "juridico-discursive." 82

Why are the deployments of power reduced simply to the procedure of the law of interdiction? 86

Power as a pure limit set on freedom is, at least in our society, the general form of its acceptability. 86

We have been engaged for centuries in a type of society in which the juridical is increasingly incapable of coding power, of serving as its system of representation. 89

We must construct an analytics of power that no longer takes law as a model and a code. 90



The analysis, made in terms of power, must not assume that the sovereignty of the state, the form of the law, or the over-all unity of a domination are given at the outset; rather, these are only the terminal forms power takes. It seems to me that power must be understood in the first instance as the multiplicity of force relations immanent in the sphere in which they operate and which constitute their own organization; as the process which, through ceaseless struggles and confrontations, transforms, strengthens, or reverses them; as the support which these force relations find in one another, thus forming a chain or a system, or on the contrary, the disjunctions and contradictions which isolate them from one another; and lastly, as the strategies in which they take effect, whose general design or institutional crystallization is embodied in the state apparatus, in the formulation of the law, in the various social hegemonies. Power's condition of possibility, or in any case the viewpoint which permits one to understand its exercise, even in its more "peripheral" effects, and which also makes it possible to use its mechanisms as a grid of intelligibility of the social order, must not be sought in the primary existence of a central point, in a unique source of sovereignty from which secondary and descendent forms would emanate; it is the moving substrate of force relations which, by virtue of their inequality, constantly engender states of power, but the latter are always local and unstable. 92-935

cautionary prescriptions

1. Rule of immanence

Between techniques of knowledge and strategies of power, there is no exteriority, even if they have specific roles and are linked together on the basis of their difference. We will start, therefore, from what might be called "local centers" of power-knowledge: 98

2. Rule of continual variations

The "distributions of power" and the "appropria- tions of knowledge" never represent only instantaneous slices taken from processes involving, for example, a cumula- tive reinforcement of the strongest factor, or a reversal of relationship, or again, a simultaneous increase of two terms. Relations of power-knowledge are not static forms of distri- bution, they are "matrices of transformations."  99

3. Rule of double conditioning

rather, one must conceive of the double conditioning of a strategy by the specificity of possible tac- tics, and of tactics by the strategic envelope that makes them work. 100

4. Rule of the tactical poly-valence of discourses

Indeed, it is in discourse that power and knowledge are joined together. And for this very reason, we must conceive discourse as a series of discontinuous segments whose tactical function is neither uniform nor stable.. 100

We must make allowance for the complex and unstable process whereby discourse can be both an instrument and an effect of power, but also a hindrance, a stumbling-block, a point of resistance and a starting point for an opposing strategy. Dis- course transmits and produces power; it reinforces it, but also undermines and exposes it, renders it fragile and makes it possible to thwart it. 101
