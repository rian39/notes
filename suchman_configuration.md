the device of _configuration_ has two broad uses. First, as an aid to delineating the composition and bounds of an object of analysis, in part through the acknowledgment that doing so so is integral not only to the study of technologies, but to their very existence as objects. And second, in drawing our analytic attention to the ways in which technologies materialize cultural imaginaries, just as imaginaries narrate the significance of technological artefacts. Configuration in this sense is a device for studying technologies with particular attention to the imaginaries and materialities that they _join together_, an orientation that resonates as well with the term's common usages to refer to the conjoining of diverse elements in practices of systems design and engineering. 48

An orientation to configuration reminds us to reanimate the figures that populate our sociomaterial imaginaries and practices, to examine the relations that they hold in places and the labours that sustain them, and to articulate the material semiotic reconfigurations required for their transformation. 58
