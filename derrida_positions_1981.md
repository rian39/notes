the question of _paleonomy_: what is the strategic necessity (...), what, then is the "strategic" necessity that requires the occasional maintenance of an _old name_ in order to launch a new concept? With all the reservations imposed by this classical distinction between the name and the concept, one might begin to describe this operation. Taking into account the fact that a name does not name the puncutal simplicity of a c conept, but rather a sysmte of predicates defining a conceptu, a conceptual structure _centered_ on a give predicate, we proceed: (1) to the extraction of a reduced predicative trait that is held in reserve, limited in a given conceptual structure (limited for motivations and relations of force to be analyzed), _named X_; (2) tot he delimitation, the grafting and regulated extension of the extracted, the name _X_ being maintained as a kind of _lever of intervention_, in order to maintain a grasp on the previous organization, which is to be transformed effectively. Therefore, extraction, graft, extension: you know that this is what I call, according to the process I have just described, _writing_. 71
