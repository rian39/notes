An important mechanism by which common information spaces can be supported is through the use of human mediators that help both producers and consumers to package and subsequently interpret information in the CIS. 91

We find further inspiration from Giddens (1990) who discusses organizations which have been delegated a certain area of societal competence which is not a part of the everyday competence of the rest of us. For such an organization it is extremely important not to reveal the complexity and ambiguity of phenomena/decisions “frontstage'' -i.e. their operations and activities are accessible visible to users.  87

Thus, to the extent that multiple actors can construct and maintain a common information space, they are able to articulate their work, and thus perform cooperative work.
