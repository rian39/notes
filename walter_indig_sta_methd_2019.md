Across ﬁrst world colonizing settler nation states, Indigenous data largely conform to what Walter (2016, 2018)) describes as 5D data. That is, mainstream Indigenous statistics focus almost exclusively on items related to Indigenous diﬀerence, disparity, disadvantage, dysfunction and deprivation. Magnifying the impact of this discursive frame, 5D data are produced within a set of research practices that tend to the aggregate, are decontextualised from their social and cultural context and simplistically analyzed with the problematic Indigene compared pejoratively to the non-Indigenous norm (Walter, 2018; Kukutai, 2016; Walter & Andersen, 2013). Evidence to support this claim is easily found through a Google search of the term ‘Indigenous statistics’ or by inserting the name of a 4th World Indigenous people into the search i.e. Native American, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, Maori, Native Hawaiian, First Nations, Alaskan Native. What comes up, invariably, is a sad list detailing Indigenous over-representation in negative health and education data, in incarceration rates and in embedded material disadvantage. Such 5D topics continue to dominate both oﬃcial statistics and academic quantitative research on Indigenous peoples. M. Walter and M. Suina,  ‘Indigenous data, indigenous methodologies and indigenous data sovereignty’, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, 22, 2019, 235.

Accepting the premise that numbers exist as per Quine (1948) diﬀers from accepting that numbers have a ﬁxed reality. Numbers are not neutral entities. Statistics are human artefacts and in colonizing nation states such numbers applied to Indigenous peoples have a raced reality (Walter, 2010; Walter & Andersen, 2013). Their reality emerges not from math- ematically supported analytical techniques but the social, racial and cultural standpoint of their creators who make assumptive determinations to collect some data and not others, to interrogate some objects over others, and to investigate some variable relationships over others. 236

Positioned as objective descriptors these numbers operate now, as they have always done, as mechanisms of unequal power relations. They deﬁne who and what Indigenous people are according to the terms of their non- indigenous producers and consumers. They also deﬁne what we cannot be. This impact is heightened by quantitative research use of numbers not just as counts, but as representatives of subjective items. Their form also conceal what is excluded; the lifeworld of those they purport to represent; Indigenous peoples. 236

The concept is defined as the right of Indigenous peoples to determine the means of collection, access, analysis, interpretation, management, dissemination and reuse of data pertaining to the Indigenous peoples from whom it has been derived, or to whom it relates (Kukutai & Taylor, 2016; Snipp, 2016). Data in this sense are not restricted to statistical data, but such data are a primary concern of the Indigenous Data Sovereignty movement and its advocacy. Data sovereignty is practiced through Indigenous data governance, which assert Indigenous interests in relation to data. The primary vehicle is Indigenous decision-making across the data ecosystem; from data conception to control of access to and usage of data. Indigenous decision-making is a prerequisite for ensuring Indigenous data reﬂects Indigenous priorities, values, culture, lifeworlds and diversity. 237

Indigenous quantitative methodologies provide an alternative epistemological, ontological and axiological approach to the creation and analysis/interpretation of Indigenous data. This approach takes Indigenous worldviews, perspectives values and dual intersubjectivites of the Indigenous Lifeworld as its central axis. In doing so, it disrupts the taken for grantedness of pejorative deﬁcit-based Indigenous data commonly seen across the colonizing nation states, exposing their realities as socio-cultural artifacts developed from non-Indigenous perspectives. 241
