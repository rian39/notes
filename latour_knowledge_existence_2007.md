knowledge is a _trajectory_, or, to use a more abstract term, a  _vector_ that projects "retroactively" its "validating power." 88

the key feature for our discussion here is not to ask from any statement, "Does it correspond or not to a given state of affairs?" but rather, "Does it lead to a continuous chain of experience where the former question can be settled retroactively?" 89-90

We tend to treat new entites for which it is absolutely crucial to maintain the continuous scheme as if they had become familiar objects already 90.
