bifurcation indicates something very different, namely, how a single reality, nature, came to be divided into two distinct realms. 6

I will use the terms “gesture”11 and “operation” to account for this division of nature, as they seem to capture most accurately the particular character of bifurcation. The fundamental question is not that of knowing whether nature is genuinely, in itself, composed of two realms, each with distinct attributes. Rather, it is a question of the means by which the differentiation of these attributes was established. 7

Starting with immediate experience, bifurcation operates by splitting such experience into two regimes of existence. In doing so, it takes that which constitutes the primary experience of nature and places it into a derivate, phenomenal realm. Once this bifurcation is established, once the two regimes are stabilized and subjective experience is rendered as epiphenomenal, it is possible to state that even if a fundamental knowledge of primary qualities is permanently postponed in fact, such knowl- edge would, by right, allow for knowledge of secondary qualities, by derivation, even if secondary qualities are the only things that we know, practically speaking. As a result, there is no need for an exploration of bodily perceptions, as such. 12

The conclusion to be drawn is that the modern invention of nature did not originate in an ontological position, either dualist or monist, but in local operations of the qualification of bodies. The ontology of the moderns comprises the manner in which they have attempted to express the permanently repeated gesture of dividing bodies and their qualities while continually masking this very operation. In short, this ontology presupposes the gestures, techniques, and operations of
division. 12-13

the bifurcation between primary and secondary qualities is the constitutive operation of the modern experience of nature 14

32 events are passages

Scientific theories are events, marked by the same characteristics of occurrence, of persistence, of historic routes, of mobile connec- tions. Thus the meaning of the event, as set out in this third state- ment, is that the “solar spectrum” event is connected to another event, “dark lines,” by the intermediary of a third type of event, that of correlation. A completely different space of events is established, one that is linked to other events, and whose existence is founded in the articulation of these other events. 34  theories are events 34

correlations exist beside occurrence and persistence as events 34

To reiterate: the method that Whitehead implicitly follows consists in exploring experience in terms of the immediate fact of the passage of nature as contained in awareness. In this respect, it is the intertwining of these com- ponents that forms the primary array of the plane of nature: the accident, the obelisk, and the dark lines correlated with the solar spectrum and the immediate fact. 35

36 nature is the event of all events 


This was the condition of the success of the theory of events: renounce any metaphysical position. 38

ch 2 -- feeling is central;

philosophy: assemblage of different modes of existence within nature

interesting discussion of why the concept_of_nature solution -- methodological maximum  of only what can be sensed, radical empiricism -- is only a 'local one' ; can't do any ontology with it, even if it does link everything up through events {#platform-positive}

Against all odds, this passage from Descartes has enabled a thinking of feeling as a constant activity that touches all aspects of the experience of a subject. This is a crucial moment in the setting out of a metaphysics of feelings, as it allows for a determining of the space of existence as well as a widening of the boundaries within which Descartes’s example was confined. Yet, even if the form of feeling has been clarified, this is not the case with regard to what comprises it. 46

When he talks of a plant, a dog, or a human being, he locates a common activity under the various modes of experience that he calls a “sense of conformation.” It is this that constitutes the primordial form of feeling. 46


Feeling is a present activity of integrating the past. 48
