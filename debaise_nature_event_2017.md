bifurcation indicates something very different, namely, how a single reality, nature, came to be divided into two distinct realms. 6

I will use the terms “gesture”11 and “operation” to account for this division of nature, as they seem to capture most accurately the particular character of bifurcation. The fundamental question is not that of knowing whether nature is genuinely, in itself, composed of two realms, each with distinct attributes. Rather, it is a question of the means by which the differentiation of these attributes was established. 7

the bifurcation between primary and secondary qualities is the constitutive operation of the modern experience of nature 14 

matter is only localization 16
    
32 events are passages

theories are events 34

correlations exist beside occurrence and persistence as events 34

36 nature is the event of all events 

ch 2 -- feeling is central;

philosophy: assemblage of different modes of existence within nature

interesting discussion of why the concept_of_nature solution -- methodological maximum  of only what can be sensed, radical empiricism -- is only a 'local one' ; can't do any ontology with it, even if it does link everything up through events {#platform-positive}

Against all odds, this passage from Descartes has enabled a thinking of feeling as a constant activity that touches all aspects of the experience of a subject. This is a crucial moment in the setting out of a metaphysics of feelings, as it allows for a determining of the space of existence as well as a widening of the boundaries within which Descartes’s example was confined. Yet, even if the form of feeling has been clarified, this is not the case with regard to what comprises it. 46

When he talks of a plant, a dog, or a human being, he locates a common activity under the various modes of experience that he calls a “sense of conformation.” It is this that constitutes the primordial form of feeling. 46
