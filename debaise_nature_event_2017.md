I will use the terms “gesture”11 and “operation” to account for this division of nature, as they seem to capture most accurately the partic- ular character of bifurcation. The fundamental question is not that of knowing whether nature is genuinely, in itself, composed of two realms, each with distinct attributes. Rather, it is a question of the means by which the differentiation of these attributes was established. 7

the bifurcation between primary and secondary qualities is the constitutive operation of the modern experience of nature 14 

matter is only localization 16
    
32 events are passages

theories are events 34

correlations exist beside occurrence and persistence as events 34

36 nature is the event of all events 

ch 2 -- feeling is central;

philosophy: assemblage of different modes of existence within nature

interesting discussion of why the concept_of_nature solution -- methodological maximum  of only what can be sensed, radical empiricism -- is only a 'local one' ; can't do any ontology with it, even if it does link everything up through events {#platform-positive}
