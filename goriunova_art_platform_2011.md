An art platform is a network platform that produces art, here understood broadly as a process of creative living with networks. A ‘classical’ art platform differentiates itself from other networks and sites by a number of the relations it establishes 2

As a process of emergence, an art platform is an assemblage of structures, notes, codes, ideas, emails, decisions, projects, databases, excitement, humour, mundane work, and confl ict. Here an art platform is best understood through the metaphor of a railway platform, as an element that unfolds in its arriving and departing trains, in tracks that cover vast spaces, in the forests those rails run through and the lakes they pass by, in the humdrum and dreams of passengers and their bags and lunches, in the hills and sunsets forming the landscape, in the rain on the train’s window, in the mechanics of an engine, logistics of rolling stock, semaphores, encounters, and in rail crashes. An art platform is never simply a technocultural object, but it is a resonance, a movement, an operation. The capillaries of aesthetic emergence in art platforms draw from the technical materiality of networks, databases, and software; from grass-roots, folklore creativity; from forces of repetition and sociality; from conflictual border zones and disjunctures between normality, capitalism, politics, quotidian labour and despair, escape, and creation. 3 {#platform-experience} {#platform-definition} {#platform-metaphor}

Or shall we instead talk of a media ecology of art platforms? We could discuss what human-technical processes emerge as art platforms, how they evolve, disassemble, change appearance, set things off. Media ecology is, first of all, a way of looking and seeing, of doing and making. An art platform is an entity, an activity, and a process of development. Ideally, it is a concept that is inclusive of a reflection upon its own media ecology. 6

Political movements and artistic laboratories, art collectives and activist groups, and other such influences on art platforms often drew on the potential of the technological, whether in terms of providing education, training, or instruments, routes of communication, distribution, and presentation for carrying out political acts or as an aesthetic dimension to work in and with. Platforms, whether they are feminist groups or youth centers, e-learning systems and participatory design toolkits, databases of artistic ideas 20 , trucks, 21 and camps 22 are all organizations of technologies, bodies, and concepts, exploring and pursuing certain kinds of knowledge, aesthetics, and politics. 9
