Meetings in Compendium's perspective:

1. are untapped knowledge-intensive events: often they are unfocused, but they can be improved with facilitated tools that help participants express and visualize views in a shared, common display; 
2. 2. can be more tightly woven into the fabric of works they are preceded and followed by much other communication and the generation of associated artifacts.
We describe how these 'conversationaI maps' can be integrated with pre/postmeeting activities and documents. Compendium's maps are designed to support the granular representation of concepts (as hypertext database objects) so that they can be spatially organized, recombined and reused in multiple contexts.2
Conversely, we have placed great emphasis on generating alternate documents directly from maps, since one of the most common purposes of meetings is to advance a pro ject deliverable of some sort, typically, an organizational document of an established genre, using established notations and stylistic conventions. We automatically transform visual 2
We describe how synchronous, face-to-face interaction can be integrated technically and socially with asynchronous, distributed interaction, often around documents that need to be critiquedf and annotated both informally (comments and threaded discussions) and formally (using organizational knowledge models, or ontologies). 3
However, we have also developed ways to generate the maps from other applications, to support the collective, conceptual analysis (e.g. chunking, clustering, linking, systematic reuse) that granular, hypertextual objects facilitate. 5 we need automatic morphing from visual maps to myriad file formats and notations for direct importing into other applications. If 7
In other words, answering questions in a natural language is easier than having to understand what the arrows and boxes mean in most other languages. 8
However, in keeping with the otion that the wider organization may prefer more conventional documents and user interfaces, we can generate a structured Web document discussion site from a map, as 9
It is useful to take the "document enrichment" a step further down the formalization route in certain domains. Having generated a document discussion environment from a map, this can be linked with ontology tools for knowledge modelling and semantic search. 11
Compendium occupies a particular region in the design space of knowledge management technologies, focusing on augmenting team interaction. The centrality of hypertextual in-situ mapping places particular emphasis on being able to capture not only structured, well understood material, but also the unexpected and informal material that may otherwise never be caught by more rigid notations or tools. 12
