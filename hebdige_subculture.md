Postit notes on this in first year music lectures

The 'sound-system', perhaps more than other institution within working-class West Indian life, was the site at which blackness could be most thoroughly explored, most clearly and uncompromisingly expressed. To a communicating hemmed in on all sides by discrimination, hostility, suspicion and blank incomprehension, the sound system appeared to represent, particular for the young, a precious inner sanctum, uncontaminated by alien influences, a black heart beating back to African on a steady pulse of dub. (38)

The sound system thus became associated with the heavier more 'rootsy' forms of reggae. The two became mutually dependent. The music was virtually exiled from the airwaves. It could live only in and through the cumbersome network of cabinets and wires, values and microphones which make up the 'system' and which, although legally the property of an individual entrepreneu, was owned in a much deeper sense by the community (39) {#device} {#freedom}
