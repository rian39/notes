Conceptually machine learning algorithms can be viewed as searching through a large space of candidate programs, guided by training experience, to find a program that optimizes a performance metric.  255

Most algorithms focus on function approximation problems, where the task is embodied in a function ... and the learning problem is to improve the accuracy of that function, with experience consisting of a sample of known input-output pairs of the function. 255
