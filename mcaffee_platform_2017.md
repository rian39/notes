Platforms are online environments that take advantage of the economics of free, perfect, and instant. To be more precise, a platform can be defined as a digital environment characterized by near zero marginal cost of access, reproduction and distribution. 137 

winning platforms .. They're early to the space. 169
... They take advantage of the economics of complementary goods whenever possible 
... They open up their platforms to a broad range of contributors and contributions.
... While they maintain a broad rule of openness, they also curate their platforms to deliver a consistent and positive experience to participants 169

The counterparts of platforms are _products_ in other words, goods and services. A ride across town is a product, while Uber is the platform people use to access it. 15

Platforms are online environments that take advantage of economics of free, perfect and instant. To be more precise, a platform can be defined as a digital environment characterized by near-zero marginal costs of access, reproduction and distribution. 137

The Internet, of course, is the platform most familiar to most of us, and the one responsible for the industrial disruptions we described earlier. In a sense, it is a platform of platforms. 137

[Discussion of complements] is quite interesting 138
Two products are complements if a drop in the price of one pushes out the demand curve for the other.

Services like DoubleClick, AppNexus and Google AdSense developed fast and automated processes for matching advertisers with content providers. 139

Network effects are also called demand-side economies of scale 141

WhatsApp shows that network effects arise at least because of the choices made by platform creators. 141

This was not technologically groundbreaking work -- standard interfaces have been around for a long time -- but it was organizationally demanding. 142

Amazon soon realized that it possessed a power new resource: a modular set of digital resources (like storage space, databases, and processing power) that could be combined and recombined almost at will -- all accessible all over the world via the company's existing high-speed Internet connections.  142

This is a common feature of digital platforms: they can unbundle resources that used to be tightly clustered together, and therefore difficult to consume one by one. 145


To get a deeper understanding of the power of platforms, we need to introduce two topics covered in every into to microeconomics course: supply and demand curves, and the idea of complements. 153

Apps and phones are complements.  ... the existence of free apps like Shazam and Angry Birds has two effects: it generates consumer surplus ... and it nudges the iPhone's demand curve outward, which is exactly what Apply wants -- more people who are willing to the pay the iPhone's price. 161.



Habits of successful platforms 168

The first generation of large, influential, and often disruptive Internet platforms covered the information industries. We're now seeing a second generation spreading throughout the rest of the economy. 186

O2O - online to offline

We predict that O2O platforms will spread quickly throughout the world of atoms, whether or not they include or involve consumers. 188 

The tools and techniques of revenue management, which have been refined by decades of research and real-world stress testing, can help greatly with this task but typically need lots of data to run well. ... Mathematically sophisticated, data-rich services like these used to be out of reach for many real-world businesses, especially small ones. 193

As these platforms grow, they offer one of the most irresistable economic properties of them all: liquidity, or the assurance that a transaction will happen without huge price changes. 193

The huge amount of data that O2O businesses generate make them fertile territory for machine learning.  194

User interface and user experience design, too, are experiencing a heyday, in large part because of the popularity of platforms. 194

O2O platforms ... really weren't possible even a decade ago. 195
i.e. smartphones, cloud computing, 

We also like O2O platforms because they bring a lot of benefits. The provide more opportunities for people who own assets ... to make use of them. 196.

Digital platforms are rapidly spreading into industries like exercise, transportation, and lodging that deal in physical goods and services. These are sometimes called O2O, or online-to-offline platforms. 197 

Like their purely digital counterparts, online-to-offline platforms can include many complementary products that increase overall demand 198

The platform model and network effects created one of the fastest growing companies in history. 201

The crowd is so valuable, in large part, because it's massively marginal: it contains huge numbers of people who are some combination of smart, well trained, experienced, tenacious and motivated, and quite far away --  geographically, intellectually, and/or socially -- from any organization's core. 259
