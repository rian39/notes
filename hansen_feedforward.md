prediction is much more than a means of control wielded by today's data industries ... in its fully scope, prediction furnishes a crucial resource that could allow human individuals and collectivities to feed data concerning the operational present of sensibility into future consciousness, and thereby, to make it relevant for future-oriented modulation of experience 201-202 {#experience} {#prediction} {#platform-positive}

prediction focalizes the challenges faced by contemporary media theory. For with the ubiquitous dissemination of probabilistic predictive technologies in our word comes a fundamental shift in the status of sensibility: ... the broadening of human experience to encompass a greater share of the microsensible domain 202 {#experience}

this imperative enjoins us to use the technologies of data capture, analysis and prediction to create a feed-forward structure capable of marshaling the full productive potentially of data -- its commonality, accessibility, and openness -- in order to improve, indeed to improve by _intensifying_, our experience 77

If such technically distributed systems afford us the menas to regain some agency over the operational moment of cultural impact, what I shall call "the operational present of sensibility," this agency comes at a certain cost: the pride of place formerly occupied by consciousness. 59 {#experience} {#thought} {#body} {#prediction}

This feed-forward structure dictates that disparate elements of higher-order (human) experience -- each one of which is an experience in its own right -- become unified for presentation to consciousness only through their convergence around a just-to-come future moment. 140

by contrast, what is at stake in the specifically technical feed-forward structure at issue here is a radical introjectin of data of sensibility gathered and analyzed by a technical system (twenty-first century media) into a vastly different techno-biotic system (supervisory consciousness) not for the purposes of the maintaining of this latter system's functioning, but for the purposes of expanding its own access to and (potentially) its agency over the material elements of its own situation. 140-141
