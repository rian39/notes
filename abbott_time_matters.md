\pard\plain \fi0\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 The phrase \hich\f0 \ldblquote \loch\f0 general linear reality\hich\f0 \rdblquote \loch\f0  denotes a way of thinking about how society works. This mentality arises through treating linear models as representations of the actual world. This representational usage can be opposed to the more cautious use of linear models in which the analyst believes that some substantive causal process logically entails patterns of relations between variables, patterns which can then be tested by that model to discover whether the actual state of affairs is consistent with the substnative mechanism proposed.  38}

\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 Many sociologists treat the world as if social causality actually obeyed the rules of linear transformations. They do this by assuming, in the theoreis that open their empirical articles, that the oscial world conssist of fiexed entities with variable attributes,that these attributes have only one causla meaning at a times; that this causl meaning does not depend on other attributes, onthe past sequence of attributes, or on the context of other entities. 59}

\plain {\f0\fs20\b0\i0 A sequence-based, central-subject/event approach reverses nearly all the GLR assumptions. It assumes, first of all, that the social world consists of fluctuating entities, accepting the demographic model just outlined. 61}

The production of the next moment of social life happens from the basis provided by that structure. And the arrangements of structure always leave openings for actions, which if they fit the situation can change the longest-enduring structures quite quickly. 257}}
