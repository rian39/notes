The phrase “general linear reality” denotes a way of thinking about how society works. This mentality arises through treating linear models as representations of the actual world. This representational usage can be opposed to the more cautious use of linear models in which the analyst believes that some substantive causal process logically entails patterns of relations between variables, patterns which can then be tested by that model to discover whether the actual state of affairs is consistent with the substnative mechanism proposed.  38

Many sociologists treat the world as if social causality actually obeyed the rules of linear transformations. They do this by assuming, in the theoreis that open their empirical articles, that the oscial world conssist of fiexed entities with variable attributes,that these attributes have only one causla meaning at a times; that this causl meaning does not depend on other attributes, onthe past sequence of attributes, or on the context of other entities. 59
Alternatives?
The demographic model principally relaxes the first fundamental assumption of GLR, that of fixed entities with variable attributes. 60
A sequence-based, central-subject/event approach reverses nearly all the GLR assumptions. It assumes, first of all, that the social world consists of fluctuating entities, accepting the demographic model just outlined. 61
The central conceptual task of the sequence approach, cognate with the conceptualization/measurement taksk of standard methods, is the colligation of events; how to separate hypothetical “events” … fomr the occurrences used to indicate them; how to choose observed occurrences so as to best indicate the course fo events. 61 See H.C White, 1970

## Temporality and process in social life
Industrial firms treat lower-level employees with clock temporality but expect higher-level ones to accept their solipsistic definitions of “how long you out to work today.” 238

## On the concept of turning point

If most things that could happen don’t happen, then we are far better  off trying first to find local patterns in data and only then looking for regularities among those patterns. Indeed, it is for this reason that cluster analysis and scaling, not regression, dominate big-money social science — market research — where the aim is to find, understand, and exploit strong local patterns.  For these are methods that seek clumps and partitions of data and make not attempt to write general transformations.  241
Thus the real alternatives to Goldthorpe’s variable approaches are not case-based approaches, but what I shall call, for want of a better term, “pattern-based approaches.”  Pattern-based approaches begin by establishing local patterns among variables before setting out to generalize.  …. This procedure will be most when much or most of the data clusters arund a few types and a consideerable portions of the data space is more or less empty. 241
The world is Markovian. But the past is encoded into the present in patterns of connections that we call structure. The production of the next moment of social life happens from the basis provided by that structure. And the arrangements of structure always leave openings for actions, which if they fit the situation can change the longest-enduring structures quite quickly. 257
