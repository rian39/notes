Tsing, Anna Lowenhaupt. Friction : An Ethnography of Global Connection. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2005.
The cultural specificity of capitalist forms arises from the necessity of bringing capitalist universals into action through worldly encounters. 4
Attention to friction opens the possibility of an ethnographic account of global interconnection. 6
Engaged universals travel across difference and are charged and changed by their travels. Through friction, universals become practically effective. Yet they can never fulfill their promises of universality. 8
Scale is the spatial dimensionality necessary for a particular kind of view, whether up close or from a distance, microscopic or planetary. I argue that scale is not just a neutral frame for viewing the world; scale must be brought into being: proposed, practiced and evaded, as well as taken for granted. 58
Since the 1990s, every ambitious world-making project has wanted to show itself able to forge new scales. 76
Ethnographic fragments ask us to pay attention to details. The travels that inspire global connection turn out to be less controllable than those the top imply. Making claims about scale, including globalization, turns out to be an arena of contention. 271
