Ostrom 1999, 2003

naturalisation of the Common Resource Pool: takes the resources as the given;

Hardin - get rid of the commons (1968) - state socialism & private ownership; population explosion; selfish individual; the herder will always put more cattle on the land.

bizarre that this is taken seriously

policy-generating approach to governing ... that which previously had not been governed, at least in its finitude. 

Why does that emerge? In the context of ongoing crisis?  Corporate appropriation of diversity ... vs ecosystem services as something that can be costed at every level.
