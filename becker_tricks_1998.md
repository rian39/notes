>In the world we live in, however, phenomena seldom have all the attributes required for them to be, unambiguously, members of a class defined by multiple criteria. [@Becker_2008a, 177]
> Uncoupling them, and treating them as capable of varying independently, turns a tech- nical problem into an opportunity for theoretical growth and articulation [@Becker_2008a, 182]
>To summarize this set of tricks: Put terms into the full set of rela- tions they imply (as “tall” implies “short” and “gifted” implies “not gif- ted”. Then look at the way that set of relations is now organized and has been organized at other times and in other places (as in under- standing that not knowing arithmetic has a different meaning and dif- ferent consequences than it did 150 years ago). And, finally, see how things came to be organized the way they are here and now, and what connections to other social arrangements sustain that set of relations. 190 

>An excellent, perhaps the best, way to enlarge the reach of a concept is to forget the name entirely and concentrate on the kind of collective activity that is taking place. 198
> If we call the choice of things to describe a sampling problem—which, of all the things we can observe about a person or situation or event, will we include in our sample of observa- tions?—then we can see that the general solution of the problem is to confront ourselves with just those things that would jar us out of the121/318 conventional categories,the conventional statement of the problem, the conventional solution 120-121 

>How do we go about finding cases that don’t fit? We can do it by paying attention to all the data we actually have, rather than ignoring what might be inconvenient or otherwise not come to our attention. 121

>Social scientists often make great progress exactly by paying attention to what their predecessors thought was boring, trivi- al, commonplace. 136 

>Researchers pick up, not very consciously, the ideas of the people they’re studying and working with. 136


>Ask where the data come from, who gathered it, what their organizational and conceptual constraints are, and how all of that affected what the table I’m looking at displays. It makes rather more work out of consulting a table than you might think necessary, but there is too much trouble built into other people’s data to run the risk of not making that effort. 144
>Treating the full range of cases, then, means including what we might otherwise leave out as in some way too weird or raunchy for proper sociologists to consider. It also means using such cases to define and point to the other end of the scale, those activities that are too good to be true, the angelic deviations. 151
>The theoretical trick that helps solve the problem is to recognize that what goes into the collection the definition has to cover governs the kind of definition we come up with. And collecting the examples is the kind of sampling problem considered in chapter 3. So we look for answers to such questions as: How do we make up those collections? What do we typically leave out? And what harm does it do to be selective in our choice of examples? Definitional problems arise exactly because we have chosen these collections in ways that ignored the injunction of chapter 3 to include the widest possible variety of cases of a phe- nomenon in our sample. [@Becker_1998,156].
> The point is that concepts presuppose that you have inspected the full range of things they cover when you formulate and define them. Now we can see one of the reasons for my earlier emphasis on methods of sampling that produce examples of that range. If you leave some phe- nomena out because of conventional prejudice or for any of the other reasons I discussed there, your concepts will be flawed. Generaliza- tions of which those concepts are components will contain a lot of noise, random variation that isn't random at all, but rather the result of systematic social biases in the selection of cases you used to define your concepts. [@Becker_1998, 156]
> concepts that don't cover the full range of cases to which they allegedly apply are flawed. [@Becker_1999, 165]
> If we systematically look for excluded cases, our work will improve. [@Becker_1998, 166]
>So, trying to figure out what you are doing, you say to yourself, “The data I have here are the answer to a question. What question could possibly be asking to which what I have written down in my notes is a reasonable answer?” [@Becker_1998]
>letting the case define the category. As in the earlier example, take the American re- volution as the model and define a category that has all the attributes (every single one, because we don't know what to leave out) of that case. Anything we find out about the case becomes a crucial part of the concept. What does that accomplish? Can we ever create any general- izations working that way? Letting the case define the concept lets you define dimensions you might see varying in other cases. [@Becker_2008a, 172]
>What is useful is the description of something more general than the particular facts we discovered, but less general than notions of identity or social interaction. Something in between, something like what Robert Merton alerted us to as “theories of the middle range." [@Becker_2008a,173]
