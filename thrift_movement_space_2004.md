1I argue that it is no longer possible to think of calculation as necessarily being precise. Rather, because of massive increases in computing power, it has become a means of making qualitative judgements and working with ambiguity. 584
Increasingly, analytic solutions are being replaced by brute computing force engendered by mass recursivity with the result that what is regarded as mathematics is spreading far beyond its original kernel of knowledge. 587
The sheer amount of calculation that is now becoming possible at all points at so many spaces is producing a new calculative sense, which I will call 'qualcalculation'. 592
[I]t is clear that a notion of population of the kind that subsequently became common in the nineteenth century has been crucial to the quantification of the world, allowing many modern statistical ideas to come into existence and to be applied in the background as a background. 588
