Reading the digital image in this way – as an object structured by a set of distinct material practices – allows us to move beyond discourses of simulation and the virtual to a theory of the digital image that is not visible in the rendered output of the screen, but which nonetheless structures and limits our engagement with computational technology 41-42 {#images} {#ensemble} {#thought}

In this sense, the hidden surface problem functions as an analogy for computational materiality itself, or more accurately the computer’s disavowal of its own materiality through the black boxing effect of the interface. Here the rendered image serves effectively as an interface for vision, configured to conform to the limitations of that vision, though not reducible to it, structured as it is by an excess of data that must be removed and restricted in order to be rendered legible. This world of graphical objects thus exists prior to the rendered output of the screen – as patch definitions, object databases, and graphical algorithms – and the image is only one of many meaningful forms this data might take. 57 {#images} {#ensemble} {#thought}
