a tendency or propensity to realize the event 11 

Propensities, it is assumed, are not mere possibilities but are physical realities 12

the introduction of propensities amounts to generalizing and extending the idea of forces again  14

they should be regarded as _inherent in a situation_ 14

we need _a calculus of relative or conditional probabilities_ as opposed _a calculus of absolute probabilities_ 16

in many kinds of events this is not the case, and the propensities cannot be measured because the relevant situation changes and cannot be repeated 17

in our real changing world, the situation and, with it, the possibilities, and thus the propensities, change all the time. They may certainly change if we, or any other organisms,  _prefer_ one possibility to another; or if we _discover_ a possibility where we have not seen one before 17

the present can be described as the continuing process of the actualization of propensities; or more metaphorically, of the freezing or the crystallization of propensities. 18

Propensities, like Newtonian attractive forces, are invisible and, like them, they can act; they are _actual_, they are _real_. 18

The world is no longer a causal machine -- it can now be seen as a world of propensities, as an unfolding process of realizing possibilities and of unfolding new possibilities 19

All non-zero possibilities, even those to which only a tiny non-zero propensity is attached, will realize themselves in time, provided they have time to do so; that is to say, provided the conditions repeat themselves sufficiently often or remain constant over a sufficiently long period of time. 19-20

What may happen in the future .. is, to some extent, open. There are many possibilities trying to realize themselves, but few of them have a very high propensity, given the initial conditions. 22

experiments. ... by creating, at will, artificial conditions that either exclude, or reduce to zero, all the interfering and disturbing propensities 23
