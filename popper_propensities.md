a tendency or propensity to realize the event 11 

the introduction of propensities amounts to generalizing and extending the idea of forces again  14
they should be regarded as _inherent in a situation_ 14

we need _a calculus of relative or conditional probabilities_ as opposed _a calculus of absolute probabilities_ 16

in many kinds of events this is not the case, and the propesnities cannot be measured because the relevant situation changes and cannot be repeated 17

in our real changing world, the situation and, with it, the possibilities, and thus the propensities, change all the time. They may certainly change if we, or any other organisms,  _prefer_ one possibility to another; or if we _discover_ a possibility where we have not seen one before 17

Propensities, like Newtonian attractive forces, are invisible and, like them, they can act; they are _actual_, they are _real_. 18

The world is no longer a causal machine -- it can now be seen as a world of propensities, as an unfolding process of realizing possibilities and of unfolding new possibilities 19
