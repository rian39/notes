The sanctification of methods of verification, of bifurcations of all kinds (belief and knowledge, subjective and objective, real and apparent, etc.) coincides with immense processes of disqualification of knowledge that have made one of us say that ‘We live in a veritable cemetery for destroyed practices and collective knowledges’ (Stengers, 2015, p. 98). What will enable us to resist a universe that can delude us at any moment? What method could protect us from those, charlatans, impostors, who are waiting for the slightest opportunity to deceive us? How can we educate a public that never ceases to fall under the spell of irrational forces against which it is powerless? For Moderns, the guideline seems to be an immoderate taste for any idea, theory, or method identifying truth as disenchantment and hurt, as destroying any reason to believe in ourselves or this world. 403

So it is not only the mistrust Moderns entertain towards their world that makes them see the danger everywhere. This world could well become effectively fearsome as a result of the way they treat it. 404

We must ask for each theory, each idea, what it does, i.e. how it transforms the universe to which it is added. And in particular for the notion of ‘progress’. We can obviously establish its components (linear time, rupture with the natural environment, objectivity of knowledge, etc.), but the essential question might be how it contributes to the manner in which the universe may ‘possess and handle itself’. Behind James’s pathos (‘the horror of becoming a dupe’, running ‘the awful risk of believing lies’, etc.) there is therefore a real ontological question: what universe is being created through and with our mistrust? 405

It is therefore at the level of abstractions that the distinction is made: there are abstractions whose effect is a thinning of what they target, as if they only find their reason and their effectiveness in the subtraction of the qualities of concrete things, of their ways of valuing their environment, of the manifold relationships they weave with others. There are, on the contrary, abstractions that thicken things, enhance unnoticed dimensions, highlight the fragile and event-driven nature of their existence.  405

We propose to call ‘generative apparatuses’ collectively designed modes of assemblage that both presuppose and induce their participants’ precursive trust in the capacity to make sense in common about situations that concern them. 410 

Just as ecological interdependencies do not meet any general definition, the ways in which humans can make themselves capable of cultivating and repopulating the areas of experience that modernity has devastated will not unify them. 410

We may well become able to feel the dense network of mutual relations maintained by the trees of a forest, but what of the experience of feeling looked at by the forest, of being aware of it as an attentive and clear-sighted presence, who knows us and can shame us? Are we able not to just tolerate it as ‘purely cultural’? 411

Seriously asking the question of ‘Other-than-humans’ seems to us necessary at a time when thinking ‘after progress’ demands from us a consent to make room. This does not mean ‘ontological liberalism’, because the proposal to put on the same footing, to recognize as equally existing everything that makes sense for humans, may irritate philosophers, but eschews the pragmatic test: what does this question of the ‘Other-than humans’ require of us, and not of humans in general? For it is we who have transformed the question ‘does it really exist?’, which can make sense in laboratories, into a general judgement operator. The involution we have associated with the Jamesian consent requires in this case the effort of putting aside our filiation haunted by the easy option of tolerance and of refusing as well to enter into abstract polemics about the existence that we would recognize of unicorns, for instance, or other centaurs that we encounter in contemporary scholastic discussions. For whom does the existence of unicorns actually matter? 411


Using the middle voice we would propose that visitors might learn to let themselves be touched – not touched by Other-than-humans, but by the way in which they create obligations for ‘their’ people. This is what we would call a pragmatic proposition, refusing to go beyond the effects but focusing on the culture of these effects. Refusing, that is, the position of the good will settlers – the tolerance of those who know that they know better, even if they remain discreet about it. But also the voracity of spiritual tourists who think they can freely appropriate what they feel attracted by. 412

Holding it lightly means consenting to render oneself sensitive to what is being explored, including the ‘gaps’ that signal the partial nature of the connection (see M. de la Cadena, note 4 below). It is consenting to give it the power to touch us, but denying ourselves the power to define it, to categorize it, that is to say, to detach what touches us from the world that has cultivated the art of welcoming it. But we must then resist the fear that could lead our hand to tighten its grip on the stick, to restore the world where we are alone. 412

lightly held, sensible materialism; exploring with a stick; not necessarily saints, but this world (Guattari)
