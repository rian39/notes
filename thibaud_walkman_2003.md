Thibaud, Jean-Paul. 2003. The Sonic Composition of the City. In The auditory culture reader, edited by M. Bull and L. Back. Oxford: Berg.
Using a Walkman in public spaces is part of an urban tactic that consists of decomposing the territorial structure of the city and recomposing it through spatio-phonic behaviours. Double movement of deterritorialization and reterritorialization. This new urban nomad is here and there at the same time, transported by the secrete rhythm ofhis Walkman and in direct contact with the place's he's walking through. 329

The walking listener reveals the hidden sides of the city according to three movements. First movement is from visible to audible. ... The second movement is from perception to action. ... The third movement is from private listening to public secret. 330-331

The Walkman functions like a technological device that introduces the senses within the urban territory. The thresholds, knots, and arrangements it creates need to be apprehended .. according to the variable combinations of visibility and audibility. 340
