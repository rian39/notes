[W]hat these reforms have formalized is the prospective value of promise, turning life science speculation into a highly profitable – indeed rational – enterprise. 28
The peculiarity of capital on this argument would lie in its tendency to create both an excess of promise and an excess of waste, or in Marx's words, a promissory surplus of life and actual devastation of life in the present. 58
In contrast, what stem cell science seeks to produce is not the potential organism … but rather biological promise itself, in a state of nascent transformability. 140
There is thus a tight institutional alliance between the arts of speculative promise and risk-taking and commercial modes of speculation such that the recent life sciences are increasingly attuned to the indeterminate promises of cellular life itself. 142
In short, what is at stake and what is new in the contemporary biosciences is not so much the commodification of biological life – that is a foregone conclusion – but rather its transmutation into speculative surplus value. 148
