> Rather than a science with consensus, the empirical evidence suggests that ecosystems and communities lack organization, structure, or function and are rather tempo- rary, contingent, and even ephemeral accidents of history (Sagoff 2006). In- deed, the idiosyncrasies of ecologies of communities and ecosystems could be a law in itself. Normative and intrinsic values of concepts like ecosystems and biodiversity, especially in a world with profound human intervention, remain problematic (Hattingh 2011).

>The categories of native and foreign are not useful. Instead, let us focus on ecological traits that cause change we find undesirable and on the causes of these changes that we should be actually worried about—destruction of habitats, erosion of diversity, soil erosion, overdevelopment, monocultures, high input agriculture, pollution of air and water. And above all let us be clear that our choices are “human made” whether for economics, aesthetics, or en- hancement of particular ecological characteristics like biodiversity, harmony, and species richness that humans have deemed important [@Subramaniam_2014,141]
