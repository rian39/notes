The Human Sciences in a Biological Age

Despite this heterogeneity, thought styles are emerging in many areas of
contemporary biology that offer the opportunity for a new relationship
between the human sciences and the life sciences. We can point to three
key features of that biology that can underpin that new relationship. 5

alongside this reduction of life to the interaction of its smallest
components, another style of thought has taken shape. This way of
thinking construes vital properties as emergent, and living organisms as
dynamic and complex systems, located in a dimension of temporality and
development, and constitutively open to their milieu – a milieu that
ranges in scale from the intracellular to psychological, biographical,
social and cultural. 5

the salience that the biological and the biomedical has achieved in
practices of self-management and self-governance. Not just in ‘the West’
but also in many other regions, individuals are coming to understand
themselves in the language of contemporary biomedicine, to judge them-
selves in terms of the norms articulated by biomedical experts, to modu-
late their bodies and minds with products that are the product ofRose
7
biomedical belief systems, to use new reproductive technologies to
manage procreation, to consider replacing worn out body parts with
artificial hips and knees, to think about reducing risks of disease with
diet and exercise, 6-7

A strange form of conceptual gerrymandering seems to underpin such
‘liberation biology’: biological claims evade critical interrogation where
they seem to give support to a pre-given philosophical ethopolitics. This
is a mirror image of the notorious tendency of life scientists to support
socio-political arguments by transposing their research on flies or mice
directly to the realm of human society and culture. 12

critics are concerned that, in claiming that the relations between our
forms of life and those of our animal forebears may not be of fundamen-
tal difference but of continuity, we will forget that only humans can
express these relations, communicate them with others, build systems
of morality, law and civility upon them. 15

The
social and human sciences need to grasp these operative philosophies of
biology and biomedicine, to explore the ‘philosophies of life’ which they
embody and the potential forms of life to which they may be linked. But
more than this, our own disciplines need to grasp the shaping – and the
all too frequent cramping – of human vitality, to engage with the sciences
and play our part in addressing the local, national and global inequities
that devastate the vital lives of so many of our fellow biological citizens. 23
