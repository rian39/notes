The very division between the 'physical' and the 'social' is itself dissolving. The complexity sciences seem to provide the best means of transcending such outdated divisions, between nature and society, between the physical sciences and  the social sciences. 18

We might being by noting that there is an emerging 'structure of feeling' that complexity both signifies and enhances ... Such an emergent structure involves a greater sense of contingent openness available to people, corporations and societies, of the diversity of geographies, of a charity towards objects and nature, of the diverse and variegated patterns of relationships, households, persons, and of the sheer increase in the hyper-complexity of products, technologies and socialities (29-30)

And yet this is paradoxical, since 'complexity' practices can themselves be conceptualized as a self-organizing global network. 30
37 questions about the effect of practices of investigation on the system observed
I have tried to show that 'complexity' provides a wide array of metaphors, concepts and theories essential for examining such intractable disoderliness. ... Complexity elaborates how there is order and disorder within all physical and social systems. (138)
Such complexity derives from what I have described as the dialectic of moorings and mobilities. (138)

Complexity theories themselves seem irreducibly part of the emergent systems of global complexity. (140)
